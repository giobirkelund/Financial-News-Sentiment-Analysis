            "text": "With volatility at historically high levels and the COVID-19 coronavirus testing the limits of the entire global financial system, investors have been sent on a hunt for yield and safety.\r\n\r\n            Since the late February highs in broad market indices, drawdowns in some passive funds have reached levels as high as 30%. According to Bloomberg data, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF saw investors withdraw more than $6.5 billion in a session, the most since October 2018.\r\n            \r\n            A question now arises; where do investors go?\r\n            \r\n            Cognizant of the extreme volatility and failure of broad-market investment vehicles to outperform in times of uncertainty, AdvisorShares Investments, a U.S.-based investment management firm founded in 2006, claims to have the solution: actively managed ETFs.\r\n            \r\n            \u201CAll of our ETFs have portfolio managers who are making decisions based on different strategies that they run, trying to outperform either on an absolute or risk-adjusted basis, some passive underlying benchmark,\u201D AdvisorShares CEO Noah Hamman told Benzinga.\r\n            \r\n            Enter your email address here...\r\n            According to Hamman, investors get access to outperforming investment vehicles whose liquidity, expenses, and transparency allow for efficient and diversified exposure in international and domestic assets.\r\n            \r\n            Hamman told Benzinga that the recent downturn brought massive interest to the firm\u2019s two all-short funds, Dorsey Wright Short Equity ETF \r\n            DWSH 1.54%\r\n             and Ranger Equity Bear ETF \r\n            HDGE 0.09%\r\n            .\r\n            \r\n            \u201CThey\u2019re actively managed, so they are not broadly shorting the good stocks, along with the bad,\u201D he said.\r\n            \r\n            \u201CWe\u2019ve seen the most amount of flows at the beginning of the year, and then, certainly over the past two weeks,\u201D added Hamman.\r\n            \r\n            In Hamman\u2019s view, the future of investing is one that includes both passive and active management; this note comes alongside comments made by successful fund managers like Michael Burry, who became famous for betting against mortgage securities.\r\n            \r\n            According to Burry, the preconditions for central bank backstops are no longer valid and that the large inflows which caused index funds to distort stock and bond prices will turn into large outflows.\r\n            \r\n            \u201CI have had a significant bearish market bet that is working out for now,\u201D Burry told Bloomberg. \u201CA global pandemic is absolutely a potential trigger for the unwinding of the passive investing bubble. With Covid-19, the hysteria appears to me worse than the reality, but after the stampede, it won\u2019t matter.\u201D\r\n            \r\n            AdvisorShares thinks it has the answer with it\u2019s blended and pureplay thematic, microcap, cannabis, equity and fixed income investment strategies. Hamman noted that sheltering investors from the storm is a top priority with its systematic, built-in hedges that withstand extreme market volatility, such as the market crash of 2020.\r\n            \r\n            \u201CWe use the iTunes analogy; I want to be able to get [managers] within your playlists -- your portfolio -- that are good, unique, not mainstream and accessible from a hundred other places.\u201D",

The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq pulled back some of their losses, but still started the trading session in negative territory.\r\n\r\n\"It has become clear that our economy will face severe disruptions,\" the Federal Reserve said in a statement. \"Aggressive efforts must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and incomes and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate.\"\r\nGlobal stock markets were hammered earlier on Monday after US lawmakers failed to reach agreement on a massive stimulus package meant to help Americans handle the coronavirus pandemic and as authorities around the world took ever more draconian measures to restrict movement and public gatherings.\r\nMarkets in Australia and South Korea's dropped more than 5%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HSI) was down 4.9% while China's Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP) shed 3.1%.\r\nIn Europe, London's FTSE 100 (UKX) was down 2.7% following the Fed announcement, while Germany's DAX (DAX) and France's CAC 40 (CAC40) were off by less than 2%.\r\nA fresh wave of coronavirus job losses is about to come crashing down\r\nA fresh wave of coronavirus job losses is about to come crashing down\r\nThere are now more than 339,000 coronavirus cases worldwide \u2014 forcing further travel restrictions, shut downs and disruptions for businesses.\r\nNew measures to combat the virus have been imposed in Australia, New Zealand and India, and the United Kingdom is considering whether further action is needed after pubs and restaurants were told to close on Friday but large numbers of people continued to gather in public spaces.\r\nIn Italy, where more people have died from coronavirus than anywhere else, the government ordered all \"non essential factories\" to close. That restriction applies to any company not involved in producing food or medical equipment. Pharmacies, food stores, financial services and public transportation will remain open.\r\nIn the United States, progress on a massive stimulus package was halted Sunday, sparking fresh uncertainty over whether and when lawmakers will reach a bipartisan deal to deliver economic relief.\r\nSenate Democrats said they have \"serious issues\" with a package being pushed by Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. On Sunday, Democratic sources said they had uncovered numerous problems with provisions dealing with aid to workers and loan assistance to businesses. While negotiations continue in the Senate, Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the House will introduce its own bill.\r\n30 days that brought the world to the brink of a depression\r\n30 days that brought the world to the brink of a depression\r\n\"The rapid spread [of the coronavirus] has triggered unprecedented draconian containment measures,\" Stephen Innes, global chief markets strategist at AxiCorp, wrote in a research note. \"All the while Congress, is dilly dallying on an aid plan.\"\r\nUS oil prices, meanwhile, fell again after a 30% plunge last week. WTI crude futures were down 1% at $22.36 a barrel while Brent crude fell 4.5%.\r\nJapan's Nikkei 225 (N225) was an outlier among major global stock markets, gaining 2% after the International Olympic Committee said Sunday it is considering postponing \u2014 but not canceling \u2014 this summer's Olympic Games in Tokyo.\r\n\r\nInternational pressure to delay the event is growing. Canada said it won't be sending teams to the Olympics this summer, and asked for the games to be postponed by one year.",

            "title": "Fed Could Bolster Groups of Businesses and Localities With Funds in G.O.P. Bill",
            "text": "Senate Republicans have proposed giving the Federal Reserve access to $425 billion in funding that it could use to extend emergency support to flailing businesses or struggling localities \u2014 an approach that would keep central bankers at the center of the coronavirus economic response in ways that could prove politically fraught.\r\n\r\nRepublican lawmakers proposed increasing a Treasury Department fund that would be used to cover losses on the Fed\u2019s emergency lending programs as part of a sweeping government rescue package. While their effort to advance the bill failed on Sunday evening, it is likely a template for what lawmakers will eventually approve.\r\n\r\nRepublicans view the Fed as a key player in offsetting the economic havoc being wrought by the coronavirus. That is partly because the Fed can take a limited amount of funds and deploy them widely: The central bank only needs the funds as a guarantee against losses, meaning the $425 billion could be leveraged to support far bigger programs. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday seemed to suggest that the backstops could amount to $4 trillion.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe can lever up to $4 trillion to help everything from small business to big business get through the next 90 to 120 days as we win this war,\u201D he said on Fox News.\r\n\r\nBut Democrats  on Sunday expressed dismay at the prospect of doling out money without a clear road map for how the funds might be used. Their opposition added a chapter to the emergency lending program\u2019s history of political controversy.\r\n\r\nDuring the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed used its emergency lending powers to inject money into Bear Stearns and American International Group, which were on the verge of collapse. The programs drew such intense and bipartisan political backlash that Congress, in the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, stripped the central bank of the ability to bail out specific institutions. Emergency programs must now be broadly available, meaning they could be tapped by five or more institutions.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading The Times.\r\nSubscribe to the Times\r\n\u201CMaking politically unpopular decisions for the long-run benefit of the country is the reason the Fed exists as a politically independent central bank,\u201D Ben S. Bernanke, who was the Fed chair at the time, wrote in his memoir. \u201CIt was created for precisely this purpose: to do what must be done \u2014 what others cannot or will not do.\u201D\r\n\r\nEconomists have speculated that this time the Fed could snap up corporate debt or local bonds using its emergency lending powers in a bid to calm dysfunctional markets, if it is given sufficient backing by the Treasury. Neither of those efforts has been tried before by the Fed and it remains unclear how such a program might work.\r\n\r\n\u201COne of the options, I think, is clearly that they could buy corporate debt and municipal debt,\u201D Ernie Tedeschi, policy economist at Evercore ISI, said of the language in the Republican bill, which nods at supporting credit provision to \u201Celigible businesses, states, or municipalities.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnalysts have also been on the lookout for a revival of a crisis-era program that the Fed used to support lending to households and small businesses. That program was called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF.\r\n\r\nThe Fed\u2019s 2020 programs will likely be less specific than the firm-specific ones it used during the Great Recession, which could shield the central bank from some criticism this time around. Mr. Mnuchin himself emphasized that the Fed-tied programs will be \u201Cbroad-based.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe legislation would have given Mr. Mnuchin $75 billion to use in loans, loan guarantees and other investments in specific industries \u2014 including air carriers and national security-related businesses \u2014 but that would be separate from the Fed-related portion.\r\n\r\nPeter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian and lawyer at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, warned that it was crucial for the Fed avoid helping specific industries.\r\n\r\nThe Fed has a \u201Cconvenient set of easy tools that allow policymakers and politicians to skip the burden of their own accountability,\u201D he said. \u201CIt\u2019s the kind of set the Fed does not want to make today \u2014 which is to pick winners and losers.\u201D\r\n\r\nFed officials have already started unveiling emergency lending programs, and so far, they have been fairly broad. Over the course of the past week, they have moved to shore up the market for short-term loans businesses use to fund day-to-day operations and acting to prevent a run on money market mutual funds, a type of popular investment vehicle.\r\n\r\nThe central bank is not legally able to take on much credit risk, so Treasury has backed those moves by pledging money from its Exchange Stabilization Fund to cover losses. That fund currently has around $94 billion in it, so the new legislation would dramatically ramp up the Fed\u2019s options when it comes to establishing future lending programs.\r\n\r\nA Treasury spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on how Mr. Mnuchin arrived at the $4 trillion figure, but Michael Feroli at J.P. Morgan said that the assumption implicit in the figure \u2014 that the Treasury would guarantee the first 12 percent of losses of any program backed by the funding \u2014 was probably reasonable.\r\n\r\nWhether a source of emergency program funding will be approved is now an open question.\r\n\r\nDuring the 2008 financial crisis, Congress gave the Treasury Department $700 billion to buy troubled assets, a small portion of which was used to back emergency lending programs at the Fed.\r\n\r\nScott Minerd, the chief investment officer of Guggenheim Investments, said the government appeared poised to revive such a program, though it appeared reluctant to use terms associated with unpopular 2008 efforts, such as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, which authorized bank bailouts.\r\n\r\n\u201CI think they\u2019re trying to stay away from using words like TALF and TARP because of the political implications,\u201D Mr. Minerd said.\r\n\r\nMr. Minerd said that while a large program would most likely be necessary, the size of the fund under consideration would probably not be sufficient.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe number of companies and industries lining up looking for largess is mind numbing,\u201D he said.",

            "text": "Oil jumped more than 3% on Monday as the Federal Reserved announced aggressive asset purchases to support markets. The move higher was a reversal from last week\u2019s steep declines, which saw U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude post its worst week since 1991.\r\n\r\nIn a volatile session that saw oil alternate between gains and losses, WTI gained 3.23% to settle at $23.36 per barrel. Earlier, prices fell as much as 6%. International benchmark Brent crude traded 0.6% higher at $27.18 per barrel.\r\n\r\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent business slowdown has pressured oil prices and sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 tumbling into bear market territory.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the Federal Reserve announced a new round of measures aimed at propping up the economy.\r\n\r\nThe central bank said it will continue to purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.\r\n\r\nTraders are hoping that this additional support will put a floor under oil prices, which have been hit especially hard by the coronavirus outbreak. WTI crude futures have been cut in half this month as a travel slowdown eats into crude demand, just as powerhouse producers Saudi Arabia and Russia prepare to ramp up production.\r\n\r\nThe rapid decline in prices has wreaked havoc in other areas of the financial markets, as investors have been forced to sell other other assets such as Treasuries or equities indiscriminately to cover losses in their energy positions.\r\n\r\nEd Morse, Citi\u2019s global head of commodity research, believes there\u2019s more downside ahead. He\u2019s forecasting crude below $20 per barrel for much of the second quarter.\r\n\r\n\u201CI think it can go much lower,\u201D he said Monday on CNBC\u2019s \u201CSquawk Alley.\u201D \u201CWe don\u2019t think the one-two punch is over, particularly on the demand side where the impact on transportation fuels in Europe and the U.S. is just beginning.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraders are also eyeing a stimulus bill from Washington, which could also boost oil prices. The massive stimulus funding package failed for a second time on Monday to get enough votes in the Senate, although Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said negotiations would continue.\r\n\r\nThe fast-spreading virus has now infected more than 350,536 people worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University, and killed at least 15,328 people. More than 100,000 people of that tally have recovered, according to Hopkins.\r\n\r\nAs traders attempt to quantify what increasingly strict travel restrictions and stay-at-home mandates will mean for longer-term crude demand, prices have swung in either direction.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday WTI dropped 24.4% to a more than 18-year low, in its third worst day on record. One day later, prices snapped back, surging 23.8% for the largest percentage gain in history. Given WTI\u2019s 60% decline this year, a smaller gain, of course, now accounts for a much larger percentage move. But the volatile swings are notable.\r\n\r\nJust as demand drops, the OPEC+ production cuts currently in place expire at the end of the month, meaning nations will soon be allowed to pump as much as they please. \r\n\r\nSaudi Arabia has announced plans to increase its daily production to a record 12.3 million barrels per day in April. By comparison, the kingdom pumped roughly 9.7 million bpd in February. Russia is among the other OPEC+ nations that has said it, too, could ramp up production.\r\n\r\n\u201CWith each day there seems to be yet another trapdoor lying beneath oil prices, and we expect to see prices continue to roil until a cost equilibrium is reached and production is shut in,\u201D said Rystad Energy analyst Louise Dickson.\r\n\r\n\u201CThis is the most dismal oil demand picture we have witnessed in a long time with a simultaneous collapse in jet fuel, gasoline, shipping fuel, petrochemicals, and oil used for power generation,\u201D she added.\r\n\r\nWTI has dropped 43.9% in March, putting it on pace for its worth month on record, back to the inception of the contract in 1983. The contract is squarely in bear market territory, currently trading 66.32% below its most recent 52-week high of $66.60 hit on April 23, 2019.",

The aerospace giant also suspended its dividend.\r\n\r\nDavid Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, said the difference between a fast or a prolonged recovery in the stock market will come down to three factors: How quickly the virus is contained, whether businesses will have \u201Caccess to enough capital and liquidity to last the 90 to 180 days,\u201D and whether fiscal stimulus can stabilize growth forecasts.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf short-term shutdowns lead to business defaults, closures, and permanent layoffs, the damage to corporate earnings growth could persist well after the virus is contained,\u201D Kostin said in a note. \r\n\r\n20200320 close SP500 bear market\r\nWall Street has been clamoring for fiscal economic relief as the number of coronavirus cases keeps surging. The number of confirmed global cases surpassed 350,000 as deaths now total over 15,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. In the U.S., more than 35,000 cases have now been confirmed.\r\n\r\nEconomists at Goldman Sachs wrote Friday they expect a 24% contraction for the second quarter after a 6% drop in the first quarter. Morgan Stanley economist Ellen Zentner said in a note Sunday she expects a historic 30% contraction in the second quarter. \r\n\r\n\u201CSuffice to say that the economy entered a unique, sudden-stop recession in March,\u201D wrote Prajakta Bhide, strategist at MRB Partners. \u201CIf there is no concrete evidence of meaningful progress toward controlling the epidemic in the next eight weeks, there will be no basis for people and businesses to feel safe to begin to normalize economic activity.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe outbreak led the New York Stock Exchange to close its trading floor and temporarily move to all-electronic trading, which began on Monday. No problems were reported and equity markets appeared to function normally.\r\n\r\nLast week, stocks suffered their biggest one-week decline since the financial crisis in 2008, with the S&P 500 dropping more than 13%. Those losses, coupled with Monday\u2019s decline, put the broader market average more than 34% below its record set on Feb. 19.\r\n\r\n20200331 Morning consult consumer confidence\r\n\u201CThings will get worse before they get better and the markets will continue to reflect that reality,\u201D said Marc Chaikin, CEO of Chaikin Analytics, in a note. \u201CThis means that a bottoming process will take more time and probably inflict more damage to equities.",

            "text": "U.S. stocks booked sharp losses Monday as the rapidly rising number of coronavirus cases across the nation overshadowed the Federal Reserve\u2019s pledge to buy unlimited bonds and bolster emergency lending facilities to support the flow of credit into the economy.\r\n\r\nThe central bank\u2019s unscheduled announcement comes as investors remain unhappy with a lack of government action to address the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\nHow did market perform?\r\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +2.24% tumbled 582.05 points, or 3%, to settle at 18,591.93, its lowest reading since Nov. 9, 2016, the day of President Donald Trump\u2019s election. The S&P 500 SPX, +2.28% slipped 67.52 points, or 2.9%, to close at 2,237.40 points. The Nasdaq Composite COMP, 1.722% shed 18.84 points, or 0.3%, to end at 6,860.67.\r\n\r\nThe weakness in equities confirmed the bearish overnight action in futures markets. All three index futures had hit their 5% daily limit at the open of trade, which began at 6 p.m. Eastern Sunday. Futures index moves that are greater than 5% trigger so-called limit-up and limit-down rules.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s important to note that the New York Stock Exchange went all-electronic on Monday, marking the first time the exchange has operated without floor traders.\r\n\r\nSee: As the stock market is in turmoil, here\u2019s what experts are watching for as the NYSE operates without humans for the first time\r\n\r\nWhat drove the market?\r\nThe Fed unleashed its most aggressive action to date in saying it would purchase an unlimited amount of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, as needed, to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy. The Fed initially said it would by $700 billion of assets.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. central bank also launched and expanded several emergency lending facilities to prop up markets for corporate credit, municipal debt and asset-backed securities.\r\n\r\n\u201CMoving to open-ended purchases sends a powerful signal to markets that the Fed will not let markets run out of control as it fights to stabilize the U.S. economy. However, this felt like it could be the final policy move from a central bank that now has few cards left to play by itself,\u201D said Oliver Blackbourn, multi-asset portfolio manager at Janus Henderson.\r\n\r\nRead: Fed is now effectively the \u2018lender of last resort\u2019 to Main Street not just Wall Street\r\n\r\nBut the Fed\u2019s actions struggled to boost sentiment as investors remain focused on the rising number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the number of confirmed cases in New York state jumped to more than 20,000, making it a hot spot in the global pandemic.\r\n\r\n\u201CEach time the Fed comes out with more stimulus, the bounce in the markets has been short-lived,\u201D said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Schwab Center for Financial Research, in an interview.\r\n\r\n\u201CI saw the Fed\u2019s actions as sort of a blank check. If that\u2019s not enough, markets are still worried about the spread of the virus,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\nInvestors also noted that an important Senate vote on coronavirus rescue package failed to gain sufficient votes on Sunday and on Monday.\r\n\r\nDemocrats have argued the details of the bill were geared toward helping Wall Street more than Main Street, as COVID-19, the infectious disease that has been contracted by more than 300,000 people globally, rapidly spreads and threatens to throw the domestic and global economy into a recession. The U.S. has recorded more than 33,000 cases so far.\r\n\r\nThe stalled bill reflects a lack of consensus between Democrats and Republicans to coalesce around a package at a crucial time for the economy and financial markets, which has been hammered as the virus has ground business activity to a halt.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, St. Louis Fed James Bullard told Bloomberg News during a Sunday interview that the U.S. unemployment rate could hit 30% in the coming months as the world continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. \u201CThis is a planned, organized partial shutdown of the U.S. economy in the second quarter,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\nCheck out:Wall Street money manager says the stock market won\u2019t hit bottom until investors throw in the towel \u2014 and we\u2019re not there yet\r\n\r\nHow did other markets trade?\r\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.594% slid around 18 basis points to 0.76%. Bond prices move in the opposite direction of yields.\r\n\r\nWest Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery CLK20, 21.861%, the U.S. benchmark of oil prices, rose 3.2% to settle at $23.36 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In precious metals, gold futures for April GCJ20, +3.09% climbed 5.6% to finish at $1,567.60 an ounce on Comex.\r\n\r\nThe ICE U.S. dollar index, DXY, 0.429% which tracks the greenback\u2019s performance against a basket of currency trading peers, fell 0.3%.\r\n\r\nGlobal equities were mixed. The Stoxx 600 Europe SXXP, +0.42% closed 4.3% lower. In Asia, China\u2019s CSI 300 000300, +1.61% fell 3.4% amd Japan\u2019s Nikkei index NIK, -1.36% gained 2%.\r\n\r\nWhich stocks were in focus?\r\nShares of General Electric Co. GE, -1.98% fell 6.3% after the industrial conglomerate said its GE Aviation unit is planning to cut 10% of its U.S. workforce, as the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a \u201Crapid contraction\u201D of air travel.\r\n\r\nShares of PG&E Corp. PCG, -1.66% surged 12.5% after the utility provider said it had resolved all state charges related to the 2018 Camp Fire through a plea agreement, which includes pleading guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter and one count of unlawfully starting a fire.\r\n\r\nBoeing Co. BA, -5.68% said it would suspend production at its Puget Sound facilities due to the coronavirus. The halt is intended to last two weeks beginning March 25. Shares of the aerospace giant, however, were finished up 11.2%.\r\n\r\nCorrections & Amplifications: An earlier version of this article had an incorrect title for Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Schwab Center for Financial Research.

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF saw investors withdraw more than $6.5 billion in a session, the most since October 2018, according to Bloomberg. \r\n\r\nWhere do investors go now?\r\n\r\nBenzinga is covering every angle of how the coronavirus affects the financial world. For daily updates, sign up for our coronavirus newsletter.\r\n\r\nCognizant of the extreme volatility and failure of broad-market investment vehicles to outperform in times of uncertainty, AdvisorShares Investments, a U.S.-based investment management firm founded in 2006, says it has the solution: actively managed ETFs.\r\n\r\n\u201CAll of our ETFs have portfolio managers who are making decisions based on different strategies that they run, trying to outperform either on an absolute or risk-adjusted basis, some passive underlying benchmark,\u201D AdvisorShares CEO Noah Hamman told Benzinga.\r\n\r\nAdvisorShares CEO Says Future Includes Both Passive, Active Management\r\nAdvisorShares investment vehicles are outperformers whose liquidity, expenses and transparency allow for efficient and diversified exposure in international and domestic assets, the CEO said. \r\n\r\nThe downturn brought massive interest to the firm\u2019s two all-short funds. \r\n\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re actively managed, so they are not broadly shorting the good stocks, along with the bad,\u201D Hamman said. \r\n\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ve seen the most amount of flows at the beginning of the year, and then, certainly over the past two weeks.\"\r\n\r\nIn the CEO\u2019s view, the future of investing is one that includes both passive and active management.\r\n\r\nAdvisorShares thinks it has the answer with its blended and pure-play thematic, microcap, cannabis, equity and fixed-income investment strategies.\r\n\r\nSheltering investors from the storm is a top priority for AdvisorShares, which has systematic, built-in hedges that can withstand extreme market volatility, Hamman said. \r\n\r\n\u201CWe use the iTunes analogy; I want to be able to get [managers] within your playlists \u2014 your portfolio \u2014 that are good, unique, not mainstream and accessible from 100 other places.\u201D",

It looks like Q2 will be down about 1%,\u201D the firm\u2019s chief investment strategist told CNBC\u2019s \u201CTrading Nation\u201D on Friday. \u201CQ2 is probably going to be the better gauge for where we go from here.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s more worried about the second quarter because the coronavirus showed up so late in the first quarter.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t think Q1 earnings will be the right guide,\u201D said Agati.\r\n\r\nFirst quarter earnings season is 16 trading days away. JPMorgan Chase kicks it off on Tuesday, April 14.\r\n\r\nWall Street consensus expected S&P 500 earnings to grow by 10% going into 2020, according to Agati. Now, it\u2019s about half. She expects earnings growth will keep falling.\r\n\r\nAgati, who has $154 billion in assets under management, sees valuations dropping further, too. Between the S&P 500\u2032s all-time highs in February and now, she said the index\u2019s forward P\/E multiples have dropped from about 19 times earnings to just under 14 times.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re not viewing valuation as a very good gauge or timing tool for relative attractiveness,\u201D she added. \u201CIt\u2019s all going to come down to the earnings backdrop.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Dow just saw its worst week since October 2008, plunging more than 17%. It\u2019s down more than 10% three out of the last four weeks. The average daily point range over the past two weeks is almost 1,500 points.\r\n\r\nThe S&P 500 has plummeted 32% since its all-time high hit last month. Plus, it\u2019s now off 22% month to date. The S&P 500 is on track for its worst monthly performance since May 1940.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe technicals have really been on the front end of this market correction,\u201D she noted.\r\n\r\nAgati contends the current situation is not a financial crisis \u2014 rather, it\u2019s a global health crisis. Her thesis is it\u2019s a near-term problem.\r\n\r\nBut, when her clients ask her if she sees any good buys in the stock market, Agati\u2019s answer is no.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe have seen tremendous multiple contraction over a very short span of time,\u201D Agati said. \u201CWe are not advising investors to start making widespread changes. We need to see the VIX settle down. That is certainly a reflector of fear and uncertainty in the market, and frankly, a lack of price discovery.\u201D",

            "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street analysts and investment managers expect another rough week for U.S. markets due to coronavirus fears, with a wild open for futures on Sunday evening as lawmakers battled over an economic aid package in Washington.\r\n\r\nFILE PHOTO: An empty street is seen in Manhattan borough following the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in New York City, U.S., March 15, 2020. REUTERS\/Jeenah Moon\/File Photo\r\nStock-market futures fell sharply and Treasury-bond futures rose, signaling more \u201Cflight-to-safety\u201D trades in the week ahead. Despite the historic plunge in share prices over the past few weeks, it is difficult to predict a bottom, Wall Street analysts and investment managers said.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe need to get some stabilization in news flow before the markets turn,\u201D said Carol Schleif, deputy chief investment officer at Abbot Downing.\r\n\r\nThe spread of coronavirus across the greater New York City area may be feeding into anxiety on Wall Street, she said. Cases there skyrocketed over the weekend, with Mayor Bill de Blasio saying hospital staff are 10 days away from running out of crucial supplies.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe total number of U.S. coronavirus cases rose to more than 33,000 as of Sunday afternoon, up from about 3,600 a week earlier, according to Reuters\u2019 tally. At least 390 people have died.\r\n\r\n(Click here here for a graphic of U.S. coronavirus cases.)\r\n\r\nSeveral states have expanded their restrictions on business operations or non-essential movement by citizens in recent days. Nearly one in three Americans is now being ordered to stay home, with bustling cities such as New York and Las Vegas all but shut down.\r\n\r\nU.S. stocks have already fallen more than 30% from their mid-February peak as the pandemic has spread, with even the safest areas of the bond market experiencing liquidity stress in a market rout not seen since the 2008 financial crisis.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nJust after futures opened on Sunday night, S&P 500 e-minis ESC1 fell 5% to hit their lower limit, oil prices dropped and Treasury bond futures rose sharply.\r\n\r\nThe decline in economic activity will obviously have a severe impact on the U.S. economy and corporate profits, but market strategists and economists said it is difficult to predict just how severe.\r\n\r\nThree major factors are how much aid the federal government will inject into the economy, how effective the aid package\u2019s structure will be and how long it takes for the number of new cases to start declining in the United States - also known as \u201Cflattening the coronavirus curve.\u201D\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Congress was close to finalizing a relief package that would offer families a one-time $3,000 payment and markets another $4 trillion to support the economy.\r\n\r\nBut it was not clear when such a measure might pass, as lawmakers argued about the particulars. A bill failed to get through the first procedural hurdle in the Senate on Sunday night.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomic data set to be released this week, including jobless claims, IHS Markit\u2019s manufacturing survey and consumer sentiment, will help determine where things stand, said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York. But he emphasized that the absence of a relief package will further sour investor sentiment.\r\n\r\nThe market is simply reflecting distress in the real world, analysts said.\r\n\r\n\u201CThis is a biological event,\u201D said Nela Richardson, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. \u201CThe market is a mere symptom of the global pandemic.\u201D",

Stock futures cratered as the two parties failed to agree on the terms of the package.\r\n\r\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell lambasted the Democrats.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re fiddling with the emotions of the American people, fiddling with the markets, fiddling with our health care,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CStep up,\u201D he added. \u201CHelp us reach an agreement so we can do what needs to be done for the American people no later than tomorrow.\u201D \r\n\r\nThe final vote tally was 47-47, well short of the 60 votes needed to advance the bill. Republicans hold a 53-47 edge in the chamber, although several GOP senators, including Rand Paul, who had tested positive for the coronavirus, were not present to vote. Others, such as Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, were in quarantine as a precaution.\r\n\r\nPresident Donald Trump was decidedly optimistic in a coronavirus task force press briefing Sunday that was unfolding as senators voted. \u201CI think you\u2019ll get there,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\nSenate Republicans last week rolled out a roughly $1 trillion proposal after working closely with the administration in a bid to slow the potentially catastrophic impact of the coronavirus on the economy. As on Monday, more than 35,000 have tested positive for the illness in the United States, a number that is expected to surge as more tests are distributed. The bill included small business loans, direct payments for individuals and billions in aid for industries like airlines whose businesses have been hit hard by the virus and efforts to stop its spread.\r\n\r\nRepublicans had hoped to come to a deal with Democrats by Monday. Hospitals, workers, companies and states have all warned they need more resources. The airline industry, which is expecting financial relief from the bill, has raised continued alarm that without getting money fast, it could face dire outcomes. \r\n\r\nThe pressure to forge a deal and pass the bill took on added urgency as several members of Congress have tested positive for the coronavirus.\r\n\r\nBut negotiations that carried through the weekend had hit a sour note by Sunday afternoon. Democrats had already been frustrated that Senate Republicans drafted a bill with the administration, excluding them from the proposed bill\u2019s original formation. \r\n\r\n\u201CFrom my standpoint, we\u2019re apart,\u201D House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters earlier Sunday.\r\n\r\n\u201CLeader McConnell had to postpone his 3 p.m. cloture vote on the motion to proceed because, thanks to Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats, he did not have the 60 votes required,\u201D Pelosi said in a statement Sunday. \r\n\r\nDemocrats on Sunday called out a number of issues they had with the bill, including a $500 billion fund to support \u201Cseverely distressed business.\u201D That includes $58 billion for passenger and cargo airlines and $17 billion for businesses critical to maintaining national security, according to a draft bill obtained by CNBC.\r\n\r\nA previous draft bill allocated $150 billion for distressed businesses, in addition to $58 billion for airlines and cargo carriers.\r\n\r\nThe bill gave considerable authority to the Treasury to implement that fund. It offered concessions to Democrats like a ban on stock buybacks for companies that receive federal aid while a loan is outstanding and maintaining payroll \u201Cto the extent practicable,\u201D but some worried those stipulations weren\u2019t strong enough. One Democratic aide said opponents believe the bill gave Treasury the power to waive the ban on buybacks. \r\n\r\nOther protections for workers and aid for hospitals were also not included. \r\n\r\n\u201CIn the midst of an unprecedented national crisis, Republicans can\u2019t seriously expect us to tell people in our communities who are suffering that we shortchanged hospitals, students, workers, and small businesses but gave big corporations hundreds of billions of dollars in a secretive slush fund,\u201D said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., whose home state is one of the hardest-hit by the disease. \r\n\r\nMurray is ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. The panel is pushing for a number of additions, including more funding for hospitals and medical equipment. It also wants the Department of Labor to create a regulatory standard protecting front-line workers, like nurses, during health crises. \r\n\r\nThe Democratic-led House Appropriations Committee previously criticized the Republican draft bill for \u201Clack of supplemental funding for federal, state and local response.\u201D\r\n\r\nAirline companies were also disappointed in the bill, which offered aid primarily in the form of loans and guarantees, rather than the mix of cash grants and loans they have sought.\r\n\r\nThe bill also left open the possibility of the government participating in the gains of its loans, including through warrants, stock options or equity. Trump has he would not be opposed to taking an equity stake in companies to which the government extends aid. \r\n\r\nThe CEOs of American, Delta, Southwest, United and other airlines said Saturday the industry would have to furlough workers without $29 billion in \u201Cworker payroll protection grants.\u201D If they receive that amount in that form, they said, they wouldn\u2019t furlough employees through Aug. 31. \r\n\r\nExecutives over the last week have sent out a series of grim letters to employees and congressional leadership, saying if the government doesn\u2019t act fast, it could cost jobs.\r\n\r\nSeveral unions also came out against the bill, urging more specific provisions to protect jobs.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Machinists will not support any relief package that does not put airline workers first,\u201D said Machinists union President Robert Martinez Jr. The union represents some 140,000 airline workers. \u201CUnlike the bank bailout, the airline industry did not create this crisis.\u201D",

            "text": ["Summary Minimize losses with put options.
            
            Current volatility levels cause extreme premiums.
            
            Write pull options on SPY, GLD and TLT.
            
            Many investors are liquidating their portfolios with huge losses. They sell all asset classes from equity to Treasuries and gold. I will explain here a better strategy to cut losses.
            
            Below is a chart of our Logical Invest Permanent Portfolio Strategy which invests in the 3 main assets: equity (SP&500), Treasuries and gold. The strategy uses a variable allocation of Treasuries and gold to hedge against equity losses. As you can see in the below chart, this worked well during previous market corrections below 20%.
            
            
            
            The next chart is a year-to-date view of the coronavirus market correction. Here you can also see that until the correction reached -15% the hedge worked well and the strategy still had a positive performance. This alone should tell every investor how important a hedge is. It gives you enough time to exit from your investments without big losses.
            
            However, the correction went on and markets began to panic. Investors began to sell everything including safe havens gold and Treasuries to cover losses and respond to margin calls.At this moment the strategy is down 12% and many investors are thinking of liquidating their positions and going to cash.
            
            
            
            In fact, there is a better way to deal with losses due to the record-high market volatility of all these asset classes.
            
            Here is an overview of the volatility of different asset classes:
            
            SP&500 the volatility reached 86
            
            
            Gold volatility reached 54
            
            
            10 year Treasury volatility reached 18
            
            
            This record-high volatility also means that option premiums reached record levels. One way to protect your portfolio is to sell holdings in SPY, GLD and TLT and also sell far-out ATM (at the money) put options of these same assets. You can also keep SPY, GLD and TLT and sell ATM calls. 1 call per 100 shares. This would be a covered call and is the same as selling naked puts. Here is an example:
            
            You have $100,000 in SPY which is about 400 shares at a price of $240.
            Now you sell these SPY shares and also sell 4 SPY put options with a strike of $240. Remember that one option is for 100 shares.
            I would sell January 15, 2021 options which trade at a premium of about $40 which is nearly 17%!!!!
            That’s all. Now you just wait until everything normalizes. The outcome scenarios are the following:
            
            If SPY goes up you will realize a maximum profit of 17%
            If SPY stays the same but volatility goes back to normal values, you will realize a profit of about 10% because of the volatility drop. Upon expiry you will get the whole 17%.
            If SPY is between $200 and $240 you will still make a profit. If the price on Jan 15, 2021 is at $220, which is 10% lower than now, you still make 9% profit.
            If SPY is below $200 on Jan 15, 2021, then you get back your 400 SPY shares for a price of $200 which means that your losses are 17% smaller than they would have been by just keeping your portfolio.
            You can do the same for GLD and TLT ETFs. GLD premium is about $16 which equals about 12% and TLT premium is about 11%.
            
            If you own the Permanent Portfolio strategy which is down about 12%, you may be able to cover all your current losses before January 15, 2021 if prices only go up a little from here. If prices go down further you can reinvest at about 11% to 17% lower prices than the current levels which should be a good place to start the next bull market.

            "title": "Why The Gold Slump In A Bear Market?",
            "text": "Gold is considered a useful way to protect your portfolio at times of market decline. Academic studies generally support this. For example, research by Dirk Baur and Brian Lucey broadly supports this conclusion for investors in the U.S. the Europe.\r\n\r\nHowever, with the recent market crash gold has performed poorly. For example, over the past month the S&P 500 has fallen approximately 30% and gold too, has lost 10%. That\u2019s not what we\u2019d expect. Though gold is never a perfect hedge, seeing gold lose value during a clear market panic is unusual. So what\u2019s going on?\r\n\r\nDash For Cash\r\nOn feature of the crisis so far is the stress on balance sheets from such an abrupt slowdown in activity. Often during recessions activity may slow somewhat as consumers hold back on purchases and business run down inventories. However, this time many businesses have been forced to shut or severely limit operations by the virus response. While a decline in revenues is never pleasant, a drop to zero income is a problem of a different order. This means that businesses need money right now. We\u2019re perhaps seeing that reflected in the markets, as there is such a broad need for cash, all available assets are being sold. On this view, gold has not been excluded from the general rush to sell, and the strength of this impulse is stronger than in the past given the abrupt economic impact. That may change as the crisis reaction becomes more measured and government support is established, but for now, cash is clearly king.\r\n\r\nStrengthening Dollar\r\nToday In: Investing\r\n\r\nThe other piece of the equation is the strengthening U.S. Dollar. Gold can be thought of, in some ways, as a currency like the Euro or British Pound. As with all currency pairs what matter is what\u2019s happening on both sides.\r\n\r\nTo understand the currency exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Euro, you need to look at both trends in the Dollar and in the Euro. The same is true of gold when priced in dollars. Here we\u2019ll consider gold priced in U.S. Dollars, and since early March the trade-weighted U.S. dollar has spiked over 3%. That matters. All else equal the price of gold would fall 3% as a result. Now, this isn\u2019t the whole issue with gold, pick any major currency and it\u2019s likely gold still shows a price drop. Still the strengthening U.S. Dollar is a contributing factor.\r\n\r\nPROMOTED\r\n\r\nCivic Nation BRANDVOICE\r\n | Paid Program\r\nWe Need Student Organizers, Not Just Student Voters\r\nUNICEF USA BRANDVOICE\r\n | Paid Program\r\nCoronavirus & Children: The Complete Guide\r\nGrads of Life BRANDVOICE\r\n | Paid Program\r\nUnexpected Heroes On The Frontlines Of COVID-19\r\nNo Guarantees\r\nThe final consideration is that any hedge or safe haven asset is never guaranteed for any given crisis. For example, in certain crises oil has been a great hedge, specifically because rocketing oil prices have caused crises in the past. However, this time oil\u2019s decline has been even more abrupt than the drop in stocks.\r\n\r\nMost studies suggest that though gold often does well in a crisis, that\u2019s not always the case. For example, gold is a useful store of value at time when inflation is expected to rise. That\u2019s less of a concern in this crisis so far.\r\n\r\nWhat Next?\r\nThis crisis is still playing out. The price moves described here will be different as soon as tomorrow. It is certainly unexpected for gold not to rise consistent with a stock market crash, but not impossible. Perhaps more worryingly for gold investors, after crashes gold then starts to perform poorly because the stock market then often rebounds. Since this crisis is still playing out, the price action of gold appears unusual in a historic context, but the abrupt decline in economic activity and extreme focus on cash is perhaps somewhat unusual too.",

            "text": "The guru emphasized that he will continue to do what he knows best regardless of policy changes\r\nMarch 22, 2020\r\nDuring times of crisis, investors look to their role models to gauge a measure of how panicked they should be. Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) is arguably the most-followed guru of them all. Beyond the scope of stock tips, Buffett is known to provide invaluable investment advice that could shape the portfolio of an investor in a way that could generate stellar returns over the long term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Federal Reserve decided to cut the target funds rate by 100 basis points on March 15, the intention was to boost credit growth in a bid to revive economic expansion. When markets opened for trading on Monday, however, stocks continued their selloff despite the measures taken by policymakers to stabilize economic activities. This is a clear indication that market participants do not keep faith with the decision-makers. With rates near zero, the world is watching whether the United States will be pushed into negative yields territory. Yahoo Finance Editor in Chief Andy Serwer contacted Buffett on Wednesday to gain some insights into the this trend. When asked about negative rates, Buffett said:\r\n\r\nWarren Buffett Stock Picks\r\nWarren Buffett Current Portfolio\r\nThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years\r\n\u201CI would say that\u2019s the most important question in the world. And I don\u2019t know the answer. Now, if we knew the answer, it wouldn\u2019t be the most important question.\u201D\r\n\r\nLater in the interview, the guru was asked whether investing in equities would change given the current interest-rate environment, to which he replied:\r\n\r\n\u201CIt reduces the hurdle rate. That\u2019s why they like to decrease it. It pushes asset values higher.\u201D\r\n\r\nFinally, Serwer wanted to know whether Buffett is scared of negative rates. After reiterating that his and Charlie Munger (Trades, Portfolio)\u2019s focus is entirely fixed on identifying attractive investment opportunities, with a smile on his lips, Buffett said:\r\n\r\n\u201CThey puzzle me. But they don\u2019t scare me.\u201D\r\n\r\nIf the Oracle of Omaha is not worried about negative yields, should retail investors be? The subject of this analysis is to find an answer to this all-important question.\r\n\r\nThe United States is not the first country to be here\r\n\r\nAs unfamiliar as sub-zero rates might be to the U.S., there are a few countries that have experienced such a macroeconomic environment in the last decade. A few European nations have seen persistently low rates, along with Japan. The table below summarizes a few important details about this phenomenon.\r\n\r\nCountry\/region\r\n\r\nCurrent policy rate\r\n\r\nThe year in which zero rates were first reported\r\n\r\nLowest reported rate\r\n\r\nSweden\r\n\r\n0%\r\n\r\n2015\r\n\r\n-0.5%\r\n\r\nDenmark\r\n\r\n-0.75%\r\n\r\n2013\r\n\r\n-0.75%\r\n\r\nEurozone\r\n\r\n0%\r\n\r\n2016\r\n\r\n0%\r\n\r\nSwitzerland\r\n\r\n-0.75%\r\n\r\n2011\r\n\r\n-0.75%\r\n\r\nJapan\r\n\r\n-0.10%\r\n\r\n2010\r\n\r\n-0.10%\r\n\r\nSource: Trading Economics\r\n\r\nAccording to economics theories, there could be two primary motivations behind negative rates.\r\n\r\nStimulating inflation.\r\nDefending the local currency.\r\nThe regions that are experiencing record low rates are developed nations. The next important step in this analysis is to evaluate the economic growth of these regions since hitting zero percent rates and determine whether the targets behind setting such rates have been achieved.\r\n\r\nNot so impressive results\r\n\r\nNone of the countries that have implemented negative rates have been able to meaningfully improve their economic growth. One could argue that if not for historically low yields, the economies of these countries would have collapsed. While that is a valid statement, Alex Graham, former treasury manager at Investec London, believes this had led to new asset bubbles instead of giving the expected benefits to the economy. The Denmark property market is a classic example. According to data from Reuters, real estate prices have skyrocketed over the last several years as investors flocked to buy houses at rock-bottom rates instead of riskier choices such as equities. The chart below plots the economic growth of countries with sub-zero yields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSource: World Bank.\r\n\r\nDespite the monetary policy stimulus, these countries have grown in line with the average world growth rate of 2.5%. The U.S., which has a much larger economy than the eurozone, could still grow at similar rates even when rates remained well and truly positive. This is a clear indication that low rates have not been as successful as they were thought to be.\r\n\r\nWill it be effective in the United States?\r\n\r\nThis is a question that even the great Oracle of Omaha doesn\u2019t have an answer to. Therefore, it would most likely be fruitless to debate over whether this is good or bad for the economy. Even though the underlying idea is to incentivize borrowers, banks are hesitant to provide free credit to small and medium enterprises in fear of being responsible for creating credit bubbles. This was seen in Japan and Denmark in the last few years.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Open Market Committee, at its October 2019 meeting, commented that negative rates would do more bad than good to the United States economy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said:\r\n\r\n\u201CNegative interest rates would entail risks of introducing significant complexity or distortions to the financial system. The Financial system in the United States is considerably different from those in countries that implemented negative interest rate policies, and that negative rates could have more significant adverse effects on market functioning and financial stability here than abroad.\u201D\r\n\r\nBanks would particularly be in the spotlight as net interest margins would come under pressure. Small, regional financial services companies would be the most vulnerable because of their limited balance sheet strength.\r\n\r\nIf negative rates are implemented, investors need to carefully evaluate the progress of the economy on a quarterly basis to gauge a measure of the effectiveness of such a decision. For now, the big picture is clearly uncertain.\r\n\r\nBuffett\u2019s neutral stance is a reflection of his investment strategy\r\n\r\nThe guru is an equity market investor and has successfully picked winning companies for decades. His investment strategy is based on identifying companies that will deliver robust financial performance under various macroeconomic conditions. Therefore, even during a negative rate environment, Buffett should be able to filter out the companies that will perform relatively poorly from the companies that will likely generate attractive returns.\r\n\r\nFor retail investors with exposure to bond markets, however, things will be different. A persistently low interest rate environment will lead to a bloodbath in bond markets as fixed income securities are inversely correlated with policy rates. The best alternative is to shop for dividend-paying companies with a strong track record of distributing wealth to shareholders during trying times. GuruFocus Screeners can be useful in identifying such companies.\r\n\r\nIt would be a futile task to spend time and money on analyzing whether the United States would benefit from zero or negative policy rates on a country level. There could be winners and losers both. As Buffett suggests, the best way forward is to dig deep into company fundamentals to unearth any possible relationship between corporate earnings and interest rates.\r\n\r\nInvestment strategy tips to generate alpha with rates near record lows\r\n\r\nFinancial services companies are trading at very cheap multiples. According to data from GuruFocus, the Shiller price-earnings ratio of this sector is 13.7 in comparison to the market multiple of 22.1. This is an indication of a possible undervaluation. However, a convergence might not occur for a long time because of the underlying interest rate environment. Therefore, investors need to conduct thorough due diligence and identify catalysts with some degree of precision before investing in this sector.\r\n\r\nSome of the industries that would benefit from ultra-low rates are listed below. With markets on a freefall, leading companies operating in all these segments of the economy can be picked at bargain prices.\r\n\r\nConsumer staples companies\r\nUtilities\r\nHealth care companies\r\nCommodities\r\nDividend-paying companies\r\nStephen Covey, the author of \"The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People,\" famously said, \"You take control of that which you can control.\" This advice is relevant to today\u2019s investors. There are limitations in assessing whether negative rates would provide the desired effects in the United States and an investor does not have control over these policy decisions. The only controllable element here is the investment decision-making process. Therefore, the focus should be on building a diversified portfolio that is likely to survive a range of interest rate possibilities, and investing in defensive industries will play a major role in doing that.",

Those might seem like the good old days, once Congress and the White House finish the coronavirus rescue package expected to be approved in the next few days.\r\n\r\nEstimates of just how big the final bill would be vary, but it\u2019s assured that it will be a historic moment for sheer fiscal force being exerted at a time of economic duress. \r\n\r\nAdministration statements over the past few days point to something on the order of $2 trillion in economic juice. By contrast, then-President Barack Obama ushered an $831 billion package through during the financial crisis.\r\n\r\nThat type of fiscal burden comes as the government already has chalked up $624.5 billion in red ink through just the first five months of the fiscal year, which started in October. That spending pace extrapolated through the full fiscal year would lead to a $1.5 trillion deficit, and that\u2019s aside from any of the spending to combat the coronavirus.\r\n\r\nAlready, the national debt stands at more than $23.5 trillion and will be on track to eclipse $25 trillion. Taxpayers shelled out $574.6 billion in fiscal 2019 on interest payments for the debt and another $229.1 billion in fiscal 2020. \r\n\r\nIn short, the shock from the COVID-19 spread will blow a fiscal hole through Washington, D.C., that could take years if not decades to patch. \r\n\r\n\u2018A bridge to the other side\u2019\r\nHand-wringing over what this will all do to the debt and deficit situation, however, will have to wait for another day. In times of crisis, there is little patience for fiscal austerity, only a sense of urgency that while government spending can\u2019t stop the virus from spreading, it can mitigate what will be profound economic damage.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s truly a bridge to the other side of an act of God,\u201D economist Paul McCulley told CNBC.com. \u201CWe\u2019ll deal down the road with the impacts on so many fronts of society with the whole thing. Right now, worrying about fiscal incontinence is the exact opposite of where we should be. We should have fiscal robustness implemented through effectively a joint venture between fiscal and monetary policy.\u201D\r\n\r\nMcCulley, a former managing director at asset management giant Pimco and now a Cornell University fellow and adjunct professor at Georgetown, has been one of the leading thinkers in economics particularly since the financial crisis. He coined the term \u201CMinsky Moment\u201D to describe sudden collapses in markets and \u201Cshadow banking\u201D for nonbank lenders that were at the center of the crisis.\r\n\r\nWATCH NOW\r\nVIDEO04:47\r\nWe need congressional action to help the Treasury and Fed to work together, former PIMCO Chief Economist says\r\nHe\u2019s an advocate of a philosophy that has taken more prominence over the past couple of years called Modern Monetary Theory \u2014 essentially the belief that debt and deficits matter less in times of low inflation and that government spending should be used to address the widened wealth gap in the U.S. as the Fed keeps interest rates low. Some of the biggest backers include Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\r\n\r\nWhile the theory has some prominent detractors such as economist Larry Summers, it is likely to become the de facto law of the land as the coronavirus economic impact intensifies. \r\n\r\n\u201CThe bank of Uncle Sam needs to be open, period,\u201D McCulley said. \r\n\r\nWhat the spending will look like\r\nMaking that happen would take a variety of forms.\r\n\r\nMcCulley sees programs run jointly between the Treasury and Federal Reserve as key, with the central bank expected to keep interest rates flowing and liquidity programs running. \r\n\r\n\u201CSaying that too much central bank independence can be a problem is something that\u2019s considered to be heretic in my profession,\u201D he said. \u201CThat\u2019s essentially what I\u2019m saying now.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis week\u2019s stimulus is projected to be a combination of direct-deposit payments to individuals, extended unemployment benefits to the millions who will be displaced from the retrenchment of activity due to social distancing and business closings, and bridge loans to businesses that will be incentivized not to lay off workers.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, the Treasury will offer guarantees to the Fed that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said would allow the central bank to leverage up to $4 trillion of liquidity for the business and financial system.\r\n\r\nThe total price tag? Unimportant, at least as long as the nation suffers through an indefinite near-shutdown.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe dude who is unemployed now gets a check and has gotten himself an asset that he can cash and go a store,\u201D McCulley said. \u201CHe\u2019s gotten an asset but Uncle Sam has gone into a hole. I have no problem with that whatsoever.\u201D\r\n\r\nStill, there will be efforts to calculate the fiscal damage.\r\n\r\nMost debt since World War II\r\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service has been warning about deficit issues for some time, and said Friday that its previous scenarios are likely to look worse as government spending accelerates.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe previously projected that adverse fiscal dynamics would increase the deficit to around 6.3% of GDP by 2029, but the coronavirus pandemic introduces significant downside risk to our medium-term fiscal outlook,\u201D Moody\u2019s analyst Gabriel Agostini said in a report. \r\n\r\n\u201COn the revenue front, a coronavirus-induced slowdown will remove workers from payrolls and weaken federal tax revenue intake. Combined with large sums of federal spending to support the economy, we expect the US fiscal deficit to rise to levels not seen since the 2008 global financial crisis, driving debt higher,\u201D he added.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATCH NOW\r\nVIDEO02:55\r\nLatest on stimulus\r\nAgostini noted that low borrowing costs will help alleviate some of the burden. The Fed a week ago slashed its benchmark interest rate to near-zero, and Treasury yields have been in historically low territory.\r\n\r\nBut the fiscal balance sheet still will look worse than it has since World War II.\r\n\r\nDuring the financial crisis, the budget deficit as a share of GDP hit a high of 9.8%. Prior to that, the only worse period came during the war when the level hit 26.9% in 1943. \r\n\r\nA $2 trillion deficit, which seems conservative given the current scenario, would push deficit to GDP to 9.4%. A $3 trillion shortfall, which seems like not much of a stretch, would take the level to 14%. \r\n\r\nHopes for growth\r\nOf course, the numbers are all fungible, and Mnuchin told Fox News that he expects short-term damage to the economy followed by \u201Cgigantic\u201D growth in the fourth quarter of 2020. The administration\u2019s efforts, though, are more geared to what\u2019s happening now.\r\n\r\n\u201CAs fiscal policy loosens, the deficit does increase quite substantially in the near term,\u201D said Jeremy Lawson, chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments. \u201CIf the government isn\u2019t filling that gap in that period where the private sector is retrenching, it effectively doubles the size of the economic shock that is taking place.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn fact, Lawson said monetary and fiscal authorities probably will have to step up their efforts. He particularly said the Fed needs to get more aggressive because while \u201Cit might feel like they\u2019re throwing the kitchen sink at this, at the moment you might say they\u2019re only throwing the tap.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo as the shock of trillion-dollar deficits will now give way to the shock of multitrillion dollar deficits, there is little else for authorities to do except keep pumping.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy using your balance sheet during the bad times, what you can actually do is help the long-term health of the budget by assuring there is an economy that can return when the private sector is able to start spending again. Then the fiscal authority can unwind that stimulus, the temporary parts of it,\u201D Lawson said. \u201CYes, it looks like it\u2019s blowing a hole in the budget, but that\u2019s probably necessary from keeping a bigger one from being blown open later on.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n",

            "text": "Last week's market action saw the biggest one-day point drop in the S&P 500 on Monday, an event that did not help investor confidence in the markets. After a rally on Tuesday, the S&P 500 fell precipitously on Wednesday. The stock market tried to stabilize late in the week. However, President Trump's Friday afternoon press conference did not generate confidence from investors or traders.\r\n\r\nThe E-Mini futures had a high of 2442 at 11:15 AM (Eastern) on Friday, but by the time Trump's press conference started 30 minutes later, it was down to 2382. It closed the day at 2266. Some are recommending that President Trump should no longer give daily press briefings, and leave them to be conducted by medical experts.\r\n\r\nSectors\r\nSector TOMASPRAY-VIPERREPORT.COM\r\nToday In: Markets\r\n\r\nThe year-to-date (YTD) sector performance is quite surprising. Since 1945, consumer staples, health care, and utilities have done best during bear markets. So far in 2020, the Consumer Staples Sector (XLP) is already down 19.97%; by comparison it was down only 15% in the bear market year of 2008. That year the S&P was down 37%, and it is already down 28.66% so far the year.\r\n\r\nXLP\r\nXLP TOMASPRAY-VIPERREPORT.COM\r\nPROMOTED\r\n\r\nGrads of Life BRANDVOICE\r\n | Paid Program\r\nFuture Proof Your Workforce\r\nUNICEF USA BRANDVOICE\r\n | Paid Program\r\nCoronavirus, Seen Through A Child\u2019s Eyes\r\nCivic Nation BRANDVOICE\r\n | Paid Program\r\nWe Need Student Organizers, Not Just Student Voters\r\nThe Consumer Staples Sector (XLP) peaked on February 28 at $64.84, before closing the month at $62.72. Each of the past four weeks, XLP has traded below the weekly starc- band. Based on the starc band analysis this means that XLP is quite oversold, and should rebound or at least move sideways for a few weeks.\r\n\r\nThere is chart support from the 2018 lows (line a) at $48.14 and the December 2018 low was $47.04. Both of these are levels to watch. On the upside, there is initial resistance at $54-$56, with the declining 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $57.68 (not shown).\r\n\r\nThe relative performance (RS) measures the performance of a stock or ETF versus the S&P 500. XLP's weekly RS has risen sharply over the past four weeks, confirming it has been leading the S&P. The on balance volume (OBV) has dropped below its flat Weighted Moving Average (WMA), but is still above the long term support (line b).\r\n\r\nXLK\r\nXLK TOMASPRAY-VIPERREPORT.COM\r\nThe next-best performing sector YTD is the Technology Select Sector (XLK), which is down 22.09% and had a low last week of $70.27. The low from early June of 2019 was $69.45 (line a) and the low in early March 2019 was $67.94, both of which are support levels. There is initial resistance in the $82-$84 area, with the declining 20-week EMA at $88.78.\r\n\r\nXLK's weekly RS made another new high two weeks ago, as XLK continues to perform stronger than the S&P 500. Its weekly OBV plunged further last week, nearing long-term support (line b). The daily indicators (not shown) are mixed, as the RS is positive while the OBV is below its WMA and therefore negative.\r\n\r\nXLV\r\nXLV TOMASPRAY-VIPERREPORT.COM\r\nThe Health Care Sector Select (XLV) closed last week at $79.09 which was just below the December 2018 low of $79.31 (line a). There is next support at the April 2018 low at $76.54 (line b). There is resistance now at last week\u2019s high of $87.55, and then in the $90 area.\r\n\r\nThe weekly RS has continued to rise strongly, after breaking through the resistance (line c), showing that the Healthcare sector is strongly outperforming the S&P 500 right now. The weekly OBV has dropped further below its WMA. From the January 22 high of $105.08, XLV is currently down 24.7%.\r\n\r\nXLV 2002\r\nXLVday TOMASPRAY-VIPERREPORT.COM\r\nThere was another sharp decline in XLV during the 2002 bear market. From the May 2002 high, XLV declined 29% before it bottomed out in late July. The day after the correction low, XLV rebounded dramatically, closing above the highs from the past three days.\r\n\r\nXLV's daily RS moved through its resistance (line a) and turned positive one day after the lows. The daily OBV made higher lows (line c) as XLV was making lower lows. The move through the downtrend (line b) confirmed the bullish divergence. The rally from the lows took XLV up 25% from the lows and lasted until late August of 2002.\r\n\r\nSPY\r\nSPY TOMASPRAY-VIPERREPORT.COM\r\nLast week, the SPY made it as high as $254.67 on Tuesday, which is the first weekly resistance level to watch. The June low at $267.62 (line a) was important support, and now becomes important resistance. The 38.2% Fibonacci support, also now resistance, is at $269.62. SPY closed 12% below its weekly starc- band.\r\n\r\nThe S&P 500 Advance\/Decline line declined further last week and is now testing the uptrend from the June-August lows (line c). This also coincides to the support from the September highs (line b). The A\/D line's WMA is now declining, so any rebound in the SPY should be checked against the A\/D line analysis.\r\n\r\n10 Year Yield\r\nTNX TOMASPRAY-VIPERREPORT.COM\r\nThe plunging interest rates have caused havoc for both bonds and stocks, but this week\u2019s stimulus package could help change the tone in the bond market. The daily chart of 10 Year T-Note Yields shows no signs yet of a bottom, as yields gapped lower late in the week.\r\n\r\nThe Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD) lines are negative and show no signs of a bottom. If rates do turn higher, it should help the Financial Sector Select (XLF), which is the second-worst sector ETF, down over 38%YTD.\r\n\r\nA short term market bottom is likely in the next week or so. It will then be the strength of the rally and the news that will help determine whether a stronger bottom can be formed, and at what levels.\r\n\r\nIn my Viper ETF Report and the Viper Hot Stocks Report, I update subscribers with my A\/D Market Trend analysis twice per week, along with specific buy and sell advice.

            "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The American economy has stopped working.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re going to try turning it off and back on again.\r\n\r\nWith confirmed cases of the coronavirus escalating rapidly, government officials have almost overnight switched off activity in large sectors of the United States. They want as few people as possible in close contact with one another in order to slow the pandemic, which may be even more widespread than official statistics suggest.\r\n\r\nThe federal government has discouraged gatherings of 10 or more people. California told 40 million residents to leave the house only for absolute necessities. Bars, shopping malls, dine-in restaurants and a host of other businesses are closing across the country. Millions of people have been laid off, or are about to be.\r\n\r\nJust as there is a public health strategy driving the government orders closing businesses and limiting daily activity outside the home, there is also an economic strategy for putting large parts of the economy on ice. It requires aggressive action by the federal government, funded by what would be the most expansive borrowing the country has seen since World War II.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nContinue reading the main story\r\nWhether the United States looks back at those job cuts as a quick blip of prevention or a devastating spiral into an economic depression depends a lot on what Congress and President Trump do in the next few days.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s what economists say needs to happen.\r\n\r\nAim to put the \u2018v\u2019 in \u2018recovery.\u2019\r\nThe United States is already falling into a sharp economic contraction: It is producing far fewer goods and services now than it did a month or a quarter ago. That contraction will persist as long as businesses are unable to open and people are not able to work. This is not happening because of any choices those workers or businesses made; it\u2019s a mandate from the government that has frozen a lot of economic activity.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading The Times.\r\nSubscribe to the Times\r\nAt some point \u2014 possibly when a vaccine for the virus comes to market, or possibly as soon as the rate of infection starts declining and widespread testing allows for more confidence that another surge is not imminent \u2014 governments will lift their restrictions and activity will start to thaw.\r\n\r\nIdeally, it would thaw quickly, with shops and restaurants reopening, workers rehired, factory production lines restarted and people spending money on things they didn\u2019t need or couldn\u2019t buy during the freeze. In that situation, the economy would grow much faster for a while than it normally does, as consumers unleash their pent-up demand.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nContinue reading the main story\r\nEconomists call that a \u201CV-shaped\u201D recovery, because growth plunges and then shoots up. It\u2019s what they\u2019re aiming for now, but it could be hard to pull off.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a recession from something like this should look like is a sudden stop and recovery,\u201D said R. Glenn Hubbard, a Columbia University economist who was a top White House economist for President George W. Bush. \u201CWhat could happen, though, is a doom loop.\u201D\r\n\r\nImageBars, shopping malls, dine-in restaurants and a host of other businesses are closing across the country.\r\nBars, shopping malls, dine-in restaurants and a host of other businesses are closing across the country.Credit...Ashley Gilbertson for The New York Times\r\nExtend companies a very large lifeline.\r\nThe \u201Cdoom loop\u201D that Mr. Hubbard and many other economists fear describes a situation in which an even moderately protracted shutdown of economic activity permanently kills waves of small businesses \u2014 and possibly entire industries, like airlines \u2014 that cannot survive very long without customers.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nContinue reading the main story\r\nA typical small business in the United States does not have enough cash on hand to cover even a month of expenses if its revenues are completely disrupted, according to research by the JPMorgan Chase Institute. In minority communities, where profit margins are often narrower, the typical cash reserve is even smaller.\r\n\r\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak\r\nShortages, stay-at-home orders and sobering economic predictions.\r\nA Labor Department report is expected to show millions more jobless.\r\nBiden calls for Democratic convention to be delayed.\r\nSee more updates\r\nUpdated 41m ago\r\nMore live coverage: Markets New York\r\nEconomists say that means Congress needs to act boldly, and fast, to keep money flowing to business owners to ensure they can reopen when the crisis abates.\r\n\r\nSign up to receive our daily Coronavirus Briefing, an informed guide with the latest developments and expert advice.\r\nSign Up\r\nThere are several possible ways to try to do that.\r\n\r\nSteven Hamilton, an economist at George Washington University who has been one of the loudest public voices calling for aggressive assistance to small businesses, and Stan Veuger of the American Enterprise Institute, want banks to offer loans to cover lost revenues for small businesses \u2014 and for the federal government to forgive the loans if the companies don\u2019t lay off workers. Mr. Hubbard and Michael R. Strain of the American Enterprise Institute have a similar proposal.\r\n\r\nAdam Ozimek, the chief economist at Upwork, and John Lettieri, the president of the Economic Innovation Group in Washington, want the government to guarantee loans with little or no interest that small businesses would pay back over a long period, regardless of whether they lay off workers. Mr. Ozimek said it would be wrong not to help companies that have already been forced into layoffs by government decisions and delays in a federal response.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nContinue reading the main story\r\n\u201CWhen the government is this late to the party,\u201D he said, \u201Cthey shouldn\u2019t punish small businesses who acted fast.\u201D\r\n\r\nEconomists stress that a successful program would be expensive: $1 trillion or more. Mr. Hubbard said a $300 billion loan program, as Senate Republicans proposed on Thursday, would be \u201Cwoefully inadequate.\u201D\r\n\r\nMr. Hamilton said this week that he worried members of Congress had \u201Cnot come to terms with the scale\u201D of what was needed. \u201CAny fiscal package less than $1.5 trillion will be inadequate,\u201D he said, \u201Cand frankly lead to a Great Depression-level economic collapse.\u201D\r\n\r\nProvide big relief for workers.\r\nCompanies are only half the equation. For the shutdown\/restart strategy to work, economists say, lawmakers must also keep money flowing to workers affected by the economic chill so they can continue to buy groceries, pay mortgage or rent and seek medical care if they are injured or sick.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nContinue reading the main story\r\nOne way to do that is by helping businesses \u2014 and hopefully keeping as many people as possible on payrolls, even if they are not working. But workers who lose jobs or hours will need more direct help.\r\n\r\nMany economists, including Claudia Sahm of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth and N. Gregory Mankiw and Jason Furman of Harvard University, have called on lawmakers to send checks of $1,000 or more to all Americans as quickly as possible. Both Mr. Trump and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, have voiced support for such payments. At least a scaled-back version of that plan is likely to be included in the stimulus bill being negotiated in Congress, with payments headed to low- and middle-income families.\r\n\r\nBut those payments will not be sufficient to cover costs of necessities for people who have suddenly seen their incomes shrink or vanish.\r\n\r\nFor that, economists say, Congress needs an emergency safety net that would sustain income for all workers who are laid off or otherwise hurt by the effects of the virus. Ideally, the economists say, that safety net would aid the public health strategy embedded in the economic shutdowns by paying as many people as possible to stay home from work and practice social distancing.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nContinue reading the main story\r\nThat could mean increased unemployment benefits and more generous paid sick leave fully funded by the government. It could also mean something like what the British government announced Friday: a plan to encourage businesses to keep paying workers by assuming up to 80 percent of their wage costs.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou need an unemployment system that in this moment can pivot to 100 percent reimbursement to 100 percent of people who are not at work,\u201D said Heather Boushey, the president of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a think tank focused on inequality and growth. \u201CAnd wage replacement for people who have hours cut back.\u201D\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t think of this as a \u2018normal\u2019 rescue.\r\nAmericans also need to start thinking of this crisis as different from almost any economic shock before it.\r\n\r\nConcerns that have guided economists in the past, like whether policies discourage people from working, do not apply in the same way now: It is hard to discourage work in sectors that the government has ordered to shut down. The same may hold for restrictions that some lawmakers want to place on spending any government aid to business, like limiting grants to businesses that keep all their workers on salary, Mr. Lettieri and others say.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nContinue reading the main story\r\nJoseph S. Vavra, an economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said that policymakers typically try to stimulate consumer demand during a recession and start recovery as quickly as possible. Right now, the goal is almost the opposite.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t think what we\u2019re trying to do is to get people to go out and shop,\u201D he said. \u201CWhat we\u2019re trying to do is provide some assistance to households so they can sit at home and don\u2019t have to go out and shop.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe better parallel here might be World War II. The government is trying to win a fight against a pandemic. That will mean spending big on the battlefront \u2014 public health efforts, like ventilators and masks \u2014 and asking personal and economic sacrifices from individuals to defeat the virus and get life back to normal again.\r\n",

            "text": "Brinksmanship over the more-than-$1 trillion coronavirus economic aid bill continued Sunday, as Democrats prevented it from moving forward on the Senate floor, but both sides agreed to keep talking.\r\n\r\nThe debate took on an added dimension as the failed procedural vote on the floor came as U.S. stock futures markets YMM20, +2.56% opened sharply lower, allowing Republicans to try to pin the blame for the market drop on Democratic recalcitrance.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe markets are already reacting to this outrageous nonsense. We have an obligation to the American people to deal with this emergency and to deal with it tomorrow,\u201D Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on the Senate floor after the 47-47 procedural vote. To move forward, Republicans needed 60 votes.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvertisement\r\nDemocrats blocked a plan by McConnell to re-vote at 9:45 a.m. Monday. The Senate will reconvene at noon.\r\n\r\nThe measure would have sent checks to all Americans, increased unemployment insurance and set up a novel plan using the Federal Reserve to make loans to companies hurt as economic activity across the country shuts down.\r\n\r\nSee: Mnuchin lays out details of Senate Republican coronavirus measure\r\n\r\nDespite the dramatic vote, the timing of which was set by McConnell, both sides were still in negotiating mode.\r\n\r\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said, \u201CThe bipartisan negotiations on this package continue, even as we speak.\u201D\r\n\r\nFor Democrats, one of the main sticking points has been the hundreds of billions of dollars the bill would provide as relief for industries affected by the coronavirus outbreak.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is a significant issue. Spending $500 billion without transparency oversight and accountability is a major challenge,\u201D said Sen.

They are the words that we sent Manward Letter subscribers earlier this month\u2026 just before the market's meltdown.\r\n\r\nThey turned out to be incredibly timely.\r\n\r\nThey might save your wealth.\r\n\r\nNormally, this sort of material is reserved only for paying subscribers\u2026 but not now. They've got plenty (we just released a bonus issue), and things are too dire.\r\n\r\nWe're living in extreme times.\r\n\r\nIn the money management world, we call market extremes \"tail events.\"\r\n\r\nIt's based on the idea of the typical bell-shaped curve, with most events evenly distributed among the middle of the spectrum, pulling the curve higher. The events on the tails of the spectrum are rare but powerful.\r\n\r\nChart - Curve\r\n\r\nEvents that dramatically lower market valuations are called \"left-tail events,\" while those that send asset prices much higher are called \"right-tail events.\"\r\n\r\nThe Great Recession of 2008 was certainly a left-tail event, while the market surge in 2019 will likely go down in history as a right-tail event.\r\n\r\nThe coronavirus is certainly a left-tail event.\r\n\r\nIt's way out there on the left.\r\n\r\nTimes like these wreak all sorts of havoc on investors who blindly follow their textbooks.\r\n\r\nThe Danger Zone\r\nA study by Martin Leibowitz and Anthony Bova in 2009 showed the dangers of a \"properly\" diversified portfolio during a left-tail event.\r\n\r\nThe team compared the results of what the traditional investing world would consider an adequately diversified portfolio - containing domestic stocks and bonds, international stocks, emerging market stocks, and real estate investment trusts - with a simple 60-40 stock-to-bond allocation.\r\n\r\nThe latter won - hands down.\r\n\r\nIt outperformed by nearly 10%. Imagine how well it would have done if that allocation were divided among a smart mix of low-correlation stocks and a unique mix of traditional and alternative bonds.\r\n\r\nThe sad fact is the harder the markets fell during the crash of 2008-09, the stronger the ties between the supposedly non-correlated assets became.\r\n\r\nWe're seeing it again. And it's crushing the herd.\r\n\r\nDuring the '08 crash, the beta of a supposedly well-diversified portfolio (a measure of a portfolio's or asset's movements in relation to the overall stock market) rose from 0.4 to a whopping 0.7.\r\n\r\nThe chart below shows the trend in action. It shows how textbook \"logic\" suddenly went out the window as \"safe\" large cap stocks suddenly found themselves going against history and moving in strong correlation with 11 other major asset classes.\r\n\r\nChart - Spike\r\n\r\nIn other words, in the high-flying days leading up to the crash, the \"proper\" mix of assets underperformed the stock market. And when the market melted down, the portfolio went along for a very nasty ride.\r\n\r\nTraditional diversification failed.\r\n\r\nIt was a sham.\r\n\r\nDuring right-tail events - when equities are soaring and indexes are crushing new highs - diversified portfolios keep a foot on the brake pedal.\r\n\r\nThe correlation between stocks and bonds is less than 0.1 (1 is a perfect correlation, and 0 is no correlation). It means if you have typical bond holdings in your portfolio like you're supposed to, you'll underperform the market.\r\n\r\nIn theory, that's fine.\r\n\r\nIt's an acceptable drag on our profits\u2026 the price we pay to protect our wealth from a downturn.\r\n\r\nBut sadly, this insurance policy is not worth its costs.\r\n\r\nAs the markets crashed in 2008, those bonds that were holding our portfolios back when times were good were now pushing them down when times were bad.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, all correlations were positive and were 0.5 or higher\u2026 often a lot higher.\r\n\r\nWe're seeing it again.\r\n\r\nHere's the headline from The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt exactly the time our portfolios could have used a healthy dose of negatively correlated assets (which see their values rise while others fall), we are once again seeing asset classes move in painful lockstep.\r\n\r\nSo-called modern diversification techniques have proven to be ineffective when the market crashes.\r\n\r\nIt's time to think differently.\r\n\r\nIt's always time to think differently.\r\n\r\nDisclosure: We expressly forbid our writers from having a financial interest in their own securities recommendations to readers.

            "text": "The price of crude has dropped to levels that we have not seen in a generation. The driver for this has been the disagreement between Russia and Saudi Arabia about decreasing production by 1.5 million barrels per day and instead increasing production by about 2 million barrels per day.\r\n\r\nThe global demand for oil until recently was about 100 million barrels per day. After nearly five years of oversupply, supply had finally come into close agreement with demand.\r\n\r\nToday In: Energy\r\n\r\nCOVID-19 is adding another, and by most accounts a more serious complication, and one that will last longer.\r\n\r\nThe impact of COVID-19 has been vastly underestimated by agencies such as the International Energy Agency. They had recently suggested that demand might drop by 90,000 barrels per day; that compares to a prediction in December 2019 that demand would go up by 900,000 barrels per day.\r\n\r\nPROMOTED\r\n\r\nUNICEF USA BRANDVOICE\r\n | Paid Program\r\nHelping Children Adjust To Remote Learning During The COVID-19 Pandemic\r\nCivic Nation BRANDVOICE\r\n | Paid Program\r\nEngaging Students In Voting Doesn\u2019t Necessitate Reinventing The Wheel\r\nGrads of Life BRANDVOICE\r\n | Paid Program\r\n3 Ways To Manage The Pressure Of Hiring Right Now\r\nA recent estimate by IHS Markit suggests that we might be in for a bigger shock. They predict that gasoline consumption in the US will drop by 55% for March and April due to COVID-19. They also indicated that jet fuel demand would be halved over the same period. Lastly, they suggest that diesel demand would be down by 20%.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean? In 2019, the US consumed 20.5 million barrels of crude oil per day. How was that crude oil consumed? On average, 45% of each barrel goes towards making gasoline; 25% towards diesel; 9% towards jet fuel and kerosene. The remaining 21% goes to heating oil, residual fuel, feedstock for plastics manufacturing and other products including paints, resins, etc. If the IHS numbers are correct, then COVID-19 would result in US demand for crude oil dropping to 12.5 million barrels per day. That\u2019s a drop of a whopping 8 million barrels per day of crude oil, or 8% of global crude production!\r\n\r\nFigure 1. Average use of each barrel of crude oil in the US\r\nFigure 1. Average use of each barrel of crude oil in the US BREAKTHROUGH ADVISOR BRIEF\r\nHowever, refineries don\u2019t work that way. They take in a staple diet of crude oil and churn out products in roughly the same proportion. Changing the output proportions would cause significant disruptions to refinery operations. Since diesel\u2019s demand is least impacted because of its use in freight transport and will control refinery output, we anticipate that the crude consumption by the US will instead drop by 4 million barrels per day. But this will be accompanied with the rapid growth of inventories for gasoline and jet fuel, at rates of 30% to 35% of average daily consumption accumulating in storage tanks. Should COVID-19\u2019s direct effects on the demand in the US last for two months (roughly how long it took China to start the recovery process), we would have built up additional reserves of gasoline and jet fuel that would last at least an additional month.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of China, the rest of the world\u2019s economy, notably Western Europe and to a lesser extent South Korea and Japan, is under similar stress as the US economy. China has started to slowly recover after four months of economic pain. Given that, we anticipate that world demand for crude oil is probably down more than 10 million barrels per day, or down more than 10% from last year\u2019s average consumption and production. The additional amount of crude being added into the market by Saudi Arabia and Russia will exaggerate this oversupply. The inventory of crude and refined products will continue to grow, so this oversupplied situation will persist for months after we have overcome the COVID-19 crisis.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that the Texas Railroad Commission, which oversees oil and gas production in Texas, and the US government are considering intervening to slow this inventory buildup using mechanisms not employed in at least 50 years. The Texas Railroad Commission is contemplating restricting production from the state\u2019s oil fields and therefore putting its thumb on the price of oil \u2013 a role it had held until the OPEC-led price shock in the 70s. Similarly, the US government is contemplating barring imports of oil, a position it has not taken since the late 50s. While these are unusual times, such measures are unlikely to change the continued depressed price of crude and refined products that exist now and that will exist well after the COVID-19 crisis starts to recede.\r\n\r\nWe in Texas are looking at lower-for-longer for crude oil no matter what the Saudis and Russians do. And with the buildup of refined product inventories, the refining industry will continue to be depressed.\r\n\r\n",

            "text": "I don't care what anyone else says. None of us have seen anything like this during our lifetimes.\r\n\r\nThe market drop is not just a \"normal\" correction with a bear market to follow.\r\n\r\nI hate to say this, but dividend growth investors might want to prepare for a reduced stream of dividend income.\r\n\r\nMany of us have faced serious corrections, recessions of varying lengths, and maybe a few here can even recall parts of the Great Depression era. I am not trying to be an alarmist here, but I have been reading some articles right here on Seeking Alpha that I consider to be ignoring some important distinctions between this pandemic nightmare and the normal ups and downs of the markets.\r\n\r\nThis Is Not Your Parents' Correction Or Recession\r\nIn the past I have seen our economy take frightening turns to the downside, only to eventually rebound while I still had time on my side. I have lived through major corrections, recessions, and of course the \"Great Recession.\" The biggest difference now from all of those scary times is the major point of this article.\r\n\r\nConsumers always kept buying! Sometimes it was more, and sometimes it was less. But when the vast majority of our economy is held up by buying and selling something - about 70% of GDP - it is all the more prudent for investors in equities and corporate bonds to think about what the near and intermediate term value of those investments will be.\r\n\r\nObviously the more time you have, the better off you are. For retired folks and those nearing retirement, I would urge everyone to consider the following steps:\r\n\r\nAre You Prepared For An Income Disaster?\r\nI have no idea if a huge spending bill being worked on within our government will have the desired impact of getting things back to \"normal.\" There might even be a brief, large relief rally by the time you read this! All of that said, in my own simple way let me offer my thoughts as to your dividend income, your timeline, and your emergency cash reserves:\r\n\r\n\u2022 If you have 20+ years prior to retirement then I would make certain you have enough emergency cash on hand to weather this storm. I wouldn't buy any shares right now, even as a as a dividend growth investor, until you know for certain that the companies you are interested in are able to continue paying and increasing its dividend. At the most, I would suggest tiny nibbles if you have the urge to buy.\r\n\r\n\u2022 If you have five to 15 years prior to retirement I would urge you to avoid reinvesting dividends even in dividend aristocrats and kings until you have a clear picture of the financial well being of the companies you are invested in. Check their debt-to-equity ratio and cash flow, as well as their cash on hand. Can they afford to continue paying a dividend? Would it be prudent for them to stop increasing or even cut their dividend for a period of time?\r\n\r\n\u2022 If you are in the relatively solid position of being able to maintain your job and your income, try to divert as much income into available cash as you can, to build your own \"pandemic war chest\". Nobody knows how long this nightmare will last.\r\n\r\n\u2022 If you are in the unfortunate position of having lost your income because you've been laid off or outright fired, you should make sure you have at least five years of cash on hand to pay your bills and maintain some semblance of your current lifestyle. If you do not have enough, consider trimming enough of your positions in your weakest-performing stocks - the ones that are riddled with debt and could face the largest reduction of consumer spending during and after this life-changing event.\r\n\r\n\u2022 If you are retired and living on a fixed income with an income stream that covers the difference between your total income and expenses, I would urge you to think about how much a decreased income stream of dividends would mean to each of your personal financial situations. For many of you, your lives would change dramatically if your dividend companies were to end, cut, or suspend their payouts. I am not suggesting that all dividend aristocrats or kings will definitely take this step, but I believe that the worst-affected companies will have very few choices to survive if they do not cut capex, eliminate share buybacks, or reduce or cut their dividends.\r\n\r\n\u2022 The worst-case scenario is that you might have to sell off portions of your portfolio in order to have enough cash on hand to close the gap between whatever dividend reduction occurs and how much you have left so you can keep paying your bills. Obviously if you have a flexibly generous budget, you might want to consider cutting back on your spending for a period of time as well. Every little bit will help you weather this storm.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing here that I can suggest that will make this scenario change, but I am sure there will be many regular investors who will continue taking a \"Pollyanna\" approach and simply dismiss me as a fearmonger! I understand that as well. I have very little skin in the game these days. Not because I anticipated this and not because I even wanted to. I had to divest all of my holdings from every account (taxable, tax-deferred, and non taxable) due to my personal health issues. And because I have taken that draconian step, I can look at this market and clearly see that what the world is now going through will be an economic game changer for a period of time - and I have no way of even venturing a guess as to what its duration will be.\r\n\r\nI have no agenda. I am not shorting the market at all and I still have hundreds of thousands of dollars invested in my son-in-law's private equity fund (commercial and residential real estate) that might be at risk for myself and my family. I have enough on hand to continue my lifestyle without ever having to own another stock for whatever remains of my lifetime (as well as my wife's). Due to the circumstances I consider myself very lucky, not smart, to be in a position of having no ax to grind!\r\n\r\nLet's Look At The Dividend Aristocrats And Kings\r\nThis website has virtually all the information you might need to begin your own personal due diligence on any of these aristocrats that you might currently own:\r\n\r\nConsumer Staples\r\nArcher-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM)| [2\/14\/20]\r\nAmcor (NYSE:AMCR) | [2\/14\/20]\r\nBrown-Forman (NYSE:BF.A) (NYSE:BF.B)| [12\/6\/19]\r\nColgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) | [2\/9\/20]\r\nClorox (NYSE:CLX) | [2\/10\/20]\r\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) | [2\/19\/20]\r\nHormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) | [12\/7\/19]\r\nKimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) | [1\/26\/20]\r\nMcCormick & Company (NYSE:MKC) | [1\/28\/20]\r\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) | [2\/14\/20]\r\nProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) | [1\/23\/20]\r\nSysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) | [11\/21\/19]\r\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) | [3\/1\/20]\r\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) | [1\/8\/20]\r\nIndustrials\r\nA.O.

The coronavirus outbreak, which has brought global economies to a near standstill, has sent the major averages tumbling into bear market territory, putting an end to the record bull run that began in the aftermath of the financial crisis.\r\n\r\nThe pace at which stocks have dropped from their peak is also a record \u2014 the fastest in history. Last month, stocks were at all-time highs. Now, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 are trading 35% and 32% below their records, while the Nasdaq-100 is 28% below its high.\r\n\r\nAs the declines continue, new record lows are constantly set.

A similar pattern has played out for the S&P. This month the index has seen its four worst point drops in history, as well as its five largest point gains. As the indices have moved higher over time larger point gains and losses amount to smaller percentage moves, of course, but the numbers are still notable.\r\n\r\nAt some point, one of those big rallies will mark the turn in this market. If you sell now, you will be left on the sidelines, hurting your long-term returns, the data shows.\r\n\r\nOne of the factors spooking investors is that, unlike prior periods of economic turmoil such as the financial crisis, this sell-off is not man-made. The Federal Reserve cannot stop the virus.\r\n\r\n\u2018Incredibly bad time\u2019 to sell\r\nAs more and more Street strategists and high-profile investors say a recession is largely unavoidable at this point, investors are offloading equities, preferring not to wait around for what could be additional losses.\r\n\r\nBut this strategy is precisely the opposite of what many say to do during times of volatility.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s an incredibly bad time for people who don\u2019t have to sell to be selling, because they are selling into an avalanche,\u201D said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at The Bahnsen Group, which oversees $2.25 billion.\r\n\r\n20200318 SP500 volatility\r\nExperts typically advise retail investors to avoid the impulse to time the market, which can be difficult even for professional traders.\r\n\r\nBank of America said that trading over a one-day period is \u201Conly marginally better than a coin-flip,\u201D while noting that \u201Cthe probability of losing money plummets to 0% over a 20-year time horizon.\u201D \r\n\r\nStill, retail investors like to try their hand, which can not only lock in losses, but also put them at risk of missing the best days.\r\n\r\nGoldman Sachs found that \u201Chouseholds,\u201D which they define as retail investors as well as some professionals such as hedge funds, are the only subset of shareholders that have \u201Csold equities during each bear market since 1950.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis is essentially the opposite of the \u201Cbuy low, sell high\u201D goal of investing. Time and again, bear markets have proven to be good buying opportunities \u2014 it can just take several years for the gains to be realized.\r\n\r\n20200313 SP500 bull bear markets\r\nFor those who can shoulder the added risk, it pays to stay invested.\r\n\r\n\u201CInvestors with longer-term investment horizons should remain invested in stocks,\u201D Goldman said, while Bank of America noted that \u201Ctime is money for equities.\u201D The firm added that \u201Cfor equity investors, the best recipe for loss avoidance is time: as time horizons lengthen, the probability of losing money in stocks has decreased.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhat to do now\r\nWall Street firms are cutting their growth forecasts for the first and second quarter of 2020, warning about the impact on GDP as the coronavirus-related slowdown rages on. But at this point many still see a recovery in the second half of the year.\r\n\r\nAnd in the meantime, there are a number of ways investors can take advantage of the sell-off in equities, even as the long-term impact of the virus remains unknown.",

            "text": "The stock market had a wild week, which ultimately ended with stocks posting their worst weekly decline since 2008. Of course, at fault are escalating concerns that the rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak is bringing the global economy to a screeching halt.\r\n\r\nStock Market Weekend Recap: The Worst Week Since 2008\r\nSource: Shutterstock\r\nThese concerns aren\u2019t going away anytime soon. If anything, they will only escalate as Covid-19 spreads more in the U.S. and across Europe.\r\n\r\nDoes that mean it\u2019s time to sell everything? Or has the stock market already priced in all this bad news? Are stock ready to bounce?\r\n\r\nGood questions. Tough answers. But, let\u2019s try to answer those tough questions in this weekend\u2019s Stock Market Weekend Recap.\r\n\r\nWhat Happened in Markets Last Week?\r\nFinancial markets last week were hit with a combination of good and bad news. By the end of the week, the bad significantly outweighed the good.\r\n\r\nOn the good news front, investors got a few reminders that the U.S. economy was on pretty solid footing heading into the coronavirus pandemic. Retail sales for February came in strong on Tuesday. So did Redbook sales for the first two weeks of March. There was some strong housing data this week, too, including a decade-best existing home sales number for February.\r\n\r\nBut, investors didn\u2019t care about any of that. Nor did they care that the Fed cut rates to zero last Sunday, or that the U.S. government is considering putting together a $1 trillion stimulus package to help aid an American economy that has essentially shut down.\r\n\r\nInstead, all investors cared about \u2014 and rightly so \u2014 was that reported coronavirus cases in the United States and throughout Europe continued to spike. From Sunday through Friday, confirmed coronavirus jumped by 90% in Italy, 130% in France, 170% in Spain, 240% in Germany and 430% in the U.S. These big jumps \u2014 indicative of the fact that the virus is not slowing in any of these countries \u2014 prompted governments to further constrict daily life, with now hundreds of millions of consumers across the globe ordered to \u201Cstay home.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe implication is that so long as this virus keeps spreading, the economy will keep tumbling. Investors are selling, partly because they know second-quarter earnings will be disastrous, and also in part because they don\u2019t see a light at the end of this tunnel.\r\n\r\nNet net, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 17.3% during the week, marking its worst weekly performance since 2008.\r\n\r\n6 TECH STOCKS WITH MONSTER GROWTH POTENTIAL\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARE BROKERS\r\nWhat Should You be Watching in Markets This Week?\r\nThis week could be equally brutal for the stock market \u2026 or it could be much better.\r\n\r\nIt increasingly appears that all markets care about is the coronavirus pandemic. Regardless of everything else, it all comes back to the number of new coronavirus cases in the U.S. and across Europe. If those numbers keep going up, stocks will keep going down. If they start going down, stocks will start going up.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s some reason to believe that the numbers in Europe will start to go down this week.\r\n\r\nThe incubation period for the coronavirus is estimated to be 14 days. Italy went into quarantine on March 9. If social distancing is working in that country, then theoretically speaking, we should start to see spread slowdown in Italy sometime this week.\r\n\r\nIf we do \u2014 and if the U.S. government can pass what is now rumored to be a $2 trillion-plus stimulus package to help assist American workers and companies during this crisis \u2014 then stocks will bounce.\r\n\r\nBut, if those numbers don\u2019t peak, and if the weekly jobless claims number on Thursday blows what are already sky-high estimates out of the water, then the stock market could be in for another painful week.\r\n\r\nBottom Line on the Stock Market\r\nBelieve it or not, we are already in a recession. Consumers drive about 70% of the U.S. economy. You can\u2019t keep all those consumers locked up at home and expect the economy not to fall into a recession. The economic data over the next week \u2014 and next month \u2014 will confirm as much.\r\n\r\nBut, that\u2019s not all that important. The stock market \u2014 already down 35% from its recent peak and trading at just 13-times forward earnings \u2014 is priced for us to enter some sort of a recession.\r\n\r\nInstead, what matters is what type of recession we are in. Is this recession going to be short, last one to two quarters, and then lead into a huge second-half rebound? Or is it going to drag on for several quarters, and potentially lead into a depression?\r\n\r\nThe answer lies in the number of new coronavirus cases reported each day. If those numbers keep going up, a prolonged recession and potential depression look likely. Stocks will keep falling. If those numbers start plateauing, however, a short recession and a quick recovery look likely. Stocks will rebound.\r\n\r\nSo, in the week ahead, pay attention to those coronavirus numbers. If they start flattening out, take that as \u201Call clear\u201D symbol for stocks to start moving higher.\r\n\r\nLuke Lango is a Markets Analyst for InvestorPlace.

            "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The coronavirus economic relief bill being finalized by the U.S. Congress will include a one-time $3,000 payment for families and allow the Federal Reserve to leverage up to $4 trillion of liquidity to support the nation\u2019s economy, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday.\r\n\r\n\r\nMnuchin, speaking on the \u201CFox News Sunday\u201D television program, said the additional liquidity measures would allow the U.S. central bank to help a broad base of businesses to get through next 90 to 120 days.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nTrump administration officials hoped to finalize the legislation on Sunday and see a vote on Monday, Mnuchin said, adding that further steps could be taken if the crisis did not abate in 10 to 12 weeks.\r\n\r\nMnuchin said the U.S. economy would clearly take a hit from the health crisis, but should rebound once the new coronavirus has been contained.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CWe need to get the money into the economy now. If we do that, we think we can stabilize the economy,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\nNearly one in four Americans, or 80 million people, were under orders to close up shop and stay home as New York, California, Illinois, Connecticut and New Jersey instituted statewide lockdowns to try to contain the rapid spread of the highly contagious respiratory illness.\r\n\r\nMnuchin downplayed a question about a possible recession, calling it a \u201Ctechnical question\u201D that was not \u201Cterribly relevant\u201D in the current situation since the government was effectively shutting down large parts of the economy to slow the virus.\u201D\r\n\r\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin answer questions during the Trump administration?s daily coronavirus briefing at the White House in Washington, U.S., March 17, 2020. REUTERS\/Jonathan Ernst\/File Photo\r\n\u201CWhen people focus on recessions, it\u2019s normally because of a prolonged economic environment,\u201D Mnuchin said. \u201CThis is a very unique situation that we\u2019ve never had before. This is the government has self-imposed shutting down large parts of the economy. And as soon as we can get the medical situation under control, we\u2019re going to reopen it.\u201D\r\n\r\nMnuchin declined to comment specifically about a Washington Post report that the Trump administration did not act on repeated warnings about the potential impact of the coronavirus from the U.S. intelligence community, but said no one expected the crisis to escalate as quickly as it had.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t think that anybody should second guess the government\u2019s actions,\u201D Mnuchin said. \u201CThis has been moving very quickly and I think we\u2019ve responded appropriately.\u201D\r\n\r\nMany critics have said the administration has been slow in both its preparation and response to the crisis as President Donald Trump for weeks played down the situation before changing his tone more recently.",

            "text": "Topline: Republican and Democratic leaders are rushing to secure a deal on a sweeping economic stimulus bill intended to shore up the economy during the coronavirus crisis; on Sunday morning, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox News Sunday that the bill is nearing completion while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled her disappointment.\r\n\r\nInvestors and consumers alike have been anxiously awaiting the passage of an economic stimulus bill that could be worth more than $2 trillion; on Sunday morning, Mnuchin told Fox News that he believed he has reached a \u201Cfundamental understanding\u201D with Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer.\r\n\u201CWe look forward to wrapping it up today,\u201D he said, and added that he expected the bill to be ready for a vote in the Senate on Monday morning. \r\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, however, disagrees; she told reporters on Sunday that \u201Cfrom my standpoint, we\u2019re apart,\u201D and said that House Democrats would be drafting their own version of the stimulus bill.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll be introducing our own bill and hopefully it will be compatible with what they discuss on the Senate side,\u201D Pelosi said.\r\nThe Republicans\u2019 bill would include small business retention loans, checks sent directly to Americans (Mnuchin said the average family of four can expect to receive $3,000), and expanded unemployment insurance for workers laid off as a result of the virus.\r\nIt would involve loans to struggling business from the Fed; \u201CWorking with the Federal Reserve, we\u2019ll have up to $4 trillion of liquidity that we can use to support the economy,\u201D Mnuchin said.\r\nMnuchin estimated that the bill will tide the U.S. economy over for 10-12 weeks, and said he would \u201Cgo back to Congress again\u201D if the economic slowdown still persists after that time.\r\nKey background: The Senate has been facing immense pressure to pass a coronavirus relief plan with the House and Trump administration as quickly as possible. Lawmakers have been negotiating this weekend in a bid to meet the White House\u2019s Monday deadline for coming to an agreement. The massive legislation aims to reassure cratering financial markets by providing relief to workers, small businesses and industries that have been impacted by the spreading pandemic. As layoffs driven by the coronavirus begin to ramp up in earnest, the U.S. is bracing for economic damage of a magnitude unlike any seen in recent memory. \r\n\r\nTangent: The Fed has already taken extraordinary steps to stabilize the U.S. economy, which is reeling from the economic damage caused by the coronavirus. It has cut interest rates to almost zero, said said it\u2019s prepared to inject trillions of dollars into the overnight repo market, slashed bank reserve requirements, and agreed to buy short term debt from companies with good credit ratings. The goal of all this activity is to pump up liquidity\u2014 in other words, it\u2019s all about the cash.",

But the swiftness of the economic shutdown and violence of the U.S. market\u2019s 30% drop in a month were not foreseen by many who had not already been wary of the market for other reasons.\r\n\r\n20200320 close SP500 bear market\r\nThe brutality of the equity-market sell-off has been so extreme and rare in its breadth and velocity, in fact, that no one would dare have predicted it in detail.\r\n\r\nInvestment-grade corporate-bond risk spreads have burst with record speed from historic lows to levels that roughly price in recessionary default rates. The number of daily S&P 500 index swings of 4% or more hit a post-World War II record. The loss in U.S market value in a month and a day is near $10 trillion.\r\n\r\nJohn Roque, technical strategist at Wolfe Research, notes that on March 12 \u2014 so far, the most intense day of downside pressure by various measures \u2014 the S&P tumbled at least 22% below its 50-day average for only the 85th day since 1929. Of those days, 65 were from 1929-1940, the Great Crash and Depression. The rest were in 1987, 2002 and the financial-crisis collapse in 2008.\r\n\r\n20200318 SP500 volatility\r\nThis extreme downside momentum often occurred in the general area of the most indiscriminate and forceful liquidation phase of a bear market \u2014 when the largest proportion of stocks were blindly unloaded and when volatility peaked. But in no case so far were these moments when the ultimate low was reached for the index itself, which often came months and sometimes many percent later.\r\n\r\nHistorical comparisons\r\nAnalysts have been combing over the prior relatively undiscussed periods when a global pandemic coincided with a nasty market drop. The Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918 occurred as the stock market shed 33% in a rapid flush, which took two years to recover. But, yes, there was also the most destructive global war to date raging at that time, so comparability to today is questionable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSource: Deutsche Bank\r\n\r\nTorsten Slok, economist at Deutsche Bank, says, \u201CToday, we may see a stronger rebound because of a more aggressive fiscal and monetary policy response. We could also see a more muted rebound as consumers and corporates rebuild cash levels, or because of a longer-lasting negative impact on corporate bond markets, or because of the unusual liquidity-driven negative correlation between equities and long rates.\u201D\r\n\r\nOthers cite the 1969 Hong Kong flu outbreak, seen as a trigger for a swift 36% decline in the S&P 500 from an all-time high ahead of a brief recession.\r\n\r\nStocks recovered relatively quickly. But there was no forced shutdown of the economy as there is now, with an instant evaporation of hundreds of billions in commercial activity throwing healthy companies into peril and casting millions into unemployment.\r\n\r\nThese features have Barry Knapp of Ironsides Macroeconomics harkening to the nasty but brief recession of 1980. \u201CLike March of 1980, the government has put the economy into a coma to try to cure a difficult problem. In 1980, the problem was the Great Inflation, and the Carter administration\u2019s restriction of credit plunged the economy into a short, sharp recession to very little effect. In 2020, the contraction might turn out to be even deeper than the 8% [second-quarter 1980] plunge in GDP; however, it is likely to slow the spread of the disease and save lives.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe 2008 crisis echoes are loudest to many, both because the trauma remains fresh and because we\u2019re seeing some of the same clogs and ruptures impair the capital markets\u2019 circulatory system.\r\n\r\nTrillions of dollars in investment strategies premised on muted volatility, ample demand for corporate credit, an inverse relationship between stock and bond prices and ample liquidity have come unspooled.\r\n\r\nEverything that\u2019s not cash has been redeemed for cash \u2013 even ordinary money-market funds have been liquidated in favor of safer Treasury money funds. The Fed is now buyer of last resort in Treasuries, commercial paper and municipal debt. Fixed-income exchange-traded funds have strayed from their underlying net asset value as investors throng the exits faster than funds can sell assets.\r\n\r\nLocating a trading low\r\nAll this serves both to stoke volatility and trigger panic signals that are at least one ingredient in markets locating some kind of trading low \u2014 even if a disorderly and fragile one.\r\n\r\nAs for stocks, they remain comparatively easy to sell. There is an enormous financial, commercial and human-capital loss accumulating by the day in this economy. Prices of publicly traded equities and corporate bonds are the most immediate way such a loss can be registered.\r\n\r\nAnalysts who track the activity of various systematic funds now say the leveraged stock-bond \u201Crisk-parity\u201D players have largely completed their purge, taking equity exposure toward financial-crisis lows \u2014 a small net positive for the prospect of stocks finding some relief.\r\n\r\nTrend-following hedge funds are heavily short this market, which makes sense and remains a source of downside pressure unless and until a major rally or policy move interrupts the adverse feedback loop they are riding.\r\n\r\nIt was possible last week to squint and see tenuous signs that the tape was gaining intermittent traction. The S&P lost 15% but with far fewer individual stocks making fresh lows. When the S&P slouched to a 4% loss Friday, it came on better market breadth and lower volume than prior down days. The Cboe Volatility Index ebbed to the mid-60s from above 80.\r\n\r\nThese are observations that fit roughly with the idea of at least a lull in the headlong liquidation phase, but they guarantee nothing. Deciphering such clues is like forecasting the weather before radar or telegraphs: Noticing how the wind ruffles the leaves, watching how the animals are acting.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re at a point where the market needs to rally soon to interrupt the mechanistic selling spiral, where a fast and vicious rally of even 10-15% would look like a mere rote bounce on a chart.\r\n\r\nAnd we\u2019re at a spot where, if the S&P fails to hold current levels near 2300, the popular next downside technical target of 2150 might not even seem all that scary because it\u2019s \u201Conly\u201D 6.7% lower - less than half what was lost last week alone.",

            "text": "Remember just a few months ago when people in the U.S. were arguing politics, complaining about taxes, lamenting over student loans, dreading rush hour commutes, and more? Those were the good old days!\r\n\r\nSeriously, given the severity of the coronavirus and how it is impacting us in the form of fear and inconvenience, those things that bothered us before the outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, in December\u2014not even three months ago\u2014don\u2019t seem so bad after all. Coronavirus has put a lot into perspective.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak began shortly before December 31, 2019, when China reported several cases of severe pneumonia in Wuhan. On January 20, the first case in the United States was confirmed. According to the World Health Organization, there are more than 209,800 confirmed cases and over 8,700 deaths as of March 20\u2014its most recent situation report at the time of writing. The situation is scary. This isn\u2019t just our country, states and local communities in the U.S. The entire world is being impacted.\r\n\r\nToday In: Leadership Strategy\r\n\r\nEven with all this \u201Cscary stuff\u201D happening around us, I\u2019ve noticed some good things happening as well. Sure, I\u2019ve noticed frustrated, angry people acting out, but I\u2019ve seen more good than bad. Some people are really stepping up. In addition to something seemingly as small as washing their hands more often, some people are stepping up in a big way and helping those less fortunate. They are donating food and time to those in need. It is refreshing to see many people thinking beyond themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen times get bad, often there is something good that comes out of it. When we finally return to normal\u2014if there ever was and will ever be such a thing\u2014I believe we will be in a better place. We\u2019ll be more appreciative of what we have. We may not sweat the \u201Csmall stuff\u201D the way we did before all this happened. Some may remember that after 9\/11 the change in people was noticeable. In the U.S. (and many places abroad), we came together to help and support each other. We became a little more patriotic and appreciative of the armed forces that protect our great nation. At least for a short while, we felt good about what we had because we realized how quickly we could lose it all.\r\n\r\nPROMOTED\r\n\r\nGrads of Life BRANDVOICE\r\n | Paid Program\r\nDiscount Tire Employee Training: Investing In The Future Workforce\r\nCivic Nation BRANDVOICE\r\n | Paid Program\r\nDon't Underestimate The Power Of The Muslim Woman\r\nUNICEF USA BRANDVOICE\r\n | Paid Program\r\nCoronavirus In The U.S.: How To Prepare\r\nWhile 9\/11 and the coronavirus crisis are different, we will experience some of the same behaviors.

Many of you have likely already experienced disruptions in your daily routines\u2014which may be frustrating in themselves. Some of you may be reading this from home instead of from your office.

            "text": "Without more current data, the economic calendar remains unimportant.\r\n\r\nNearly everyone sees an imminent recession.  Time to reset for a new business cycle?\r\n\r\nUntil we see more evidence about the spread and\/or containment of the pandemic, economic and stock value conclusions are completely speculative.\r\n\r\nThere is plenty of good news in the aggressive reactions of governments, citizens, and scientists.\r\n\r\nThe narrative for the problem is easier to put in a news story than the narrative for possible solutions.\r\n\r\nOnce again, no one cares about the economic calendar. There have been big changes with more to come. While many claim to know what those changes will be, I see only speculation.\r\n\r\nWe must embark on a quest for clarity.\r\n\r\nThis implies the willingness to seek new information and go where it leads us.\r\n\r\nLast Week Recap\r\nIn my last installment of WTWA, I predicted an explosion of pundit predictions. In a world without meaningful data, all opinions are equal. This was an accurate guess. I will not spend much time on the noise. Suffice to say that uncertainty reinforced fear. All stocks and sectors moved in a highly correlated fashion. The week began with a negative reaction to the second emergency Fed move, reducing rates to near-zero. Instead of calming markets, this created additional panic among those who thought the Fed knew something they did not and was now \u201Cout of bullets.\u201D Ironically, these were many of the same folks who have been demanding lower rates and who believe the Fed knows nothing. Go figure.\r\n\r\nIt was another week where a look at the news would provide little information about stock prices. The COVID-19 spread continued as informed observers expected, but stocks treated the continuing story as fresh news each day.\r\n\r\nThe Story in One Chart\r\nI always start my personal review of the week by looking at a great chart. This week I am featuring Jill Mislinski\u2019s version, an excellent combination of key variables.\r\n\r\nA close up of text on a white background Description automatically generated\r\n\r\nThe market lost 15.0% on the week. Once stocks had gapped lower Monday morning, the range for the rest of the week was 11.6%. Every day of the week included moves of 1000 points or more in the DJIA. You can monitor volatility, implied volatility, and historical comparisons in my weekly Indicator Snapshot in the Quant Corner below.\r\n\r\nHere is the updated news on the total drawdown so far.\r\n\r\nA picture containing text, table, yellow, standing Description automatically generated\r\n\r\nSee the full post for even more great charts and analysis.\r\n\r\nPersonal Note\r\nI was supposed to take a break from writing for a couple of weeks, but I applied for special dispensation from Mrs. OldProf to post a few thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe News\r\nEach week I break down events into good and bad. For our purposes, \u201Cgood\u201D has two components. The news must be market friendly and better than expectations. I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news \u2013 and you should, too!\r\n\r\nNew Deal Democrat\u2019s high frequency indicators are a valuable part of my economic review. His approach divides indicators into three time frames. Currently, the long leading indicators remain positive, but the short-term forecast and nowcast have turned decisively negative. The coronavirus recession is here. The long leading indicators \u201Care telling us that once the crisis passes, whenever that may be, conditions are favorable for the underlying economy.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhenever that may be\u201D is the key question for everyone to consider.\r\n\r\nUntil economic data begins to cover the relevant time period, I am going to stop the weekly updates. The Fed surveys showed weakness. We should expect to see more of that in other survey data. Initial jobless claims jumped from 211K to 281K. The report covers the survey period for the next official employment situation report. Leaked reports from state offices suggest that Thursday\u2019s numbers will be much worse. Estimates range from 500K to 750K.\r\n\r\nInstead of an economic focus, I will use our traditional format to organize significant weekly developments.\r\n\r\nThe Good\r\nPolicy actions\r\nThe Fed aggressively employed the obvious measures. Here is a description of the actions, cooperation with other central banks, and a comparison with 2008.\r\nExpanded Fed Moves to come. Asset purchases have been increased, emergency lending has been included, and other items from the 2008 toolkit have been dusted off. It is just the start. And big banks are all borrowing (despite no need for funds) to remove the stigma.\r\nState restrictions on social distancing \u2013 essential to flatten the curve.\r\nIncrease in drive-through testing.\r\nPresidential emergency powers \u2013 on funds and in helping states\r\nCongressional action. It seems like an agreement on a stimulus bill is taking forever, but for Congress this really is \u201Cwarp speed.\u201D\r\nScientific news\r\nTreatment could be available \u201Cquickly\u201D says Regeneron\u2019s CEO. The interesting article covers alternatives, development methods, and financial incentives for companies.\r\nGilead\u2019s (GILD) COVID-19 drug could be approved \u201Cvery soon.\u201D (The Fly).\r\nNew coronavirus test returns results in 45 minutes, but it may be limited to hospitals\r\nPrivate action\r\nMany companies are helping employees with sick leave policies and extra cash.\r\nUnderlying economy. 2008 comparisons not warranted. Barron\u2019s on banks.\r\nThe Bad\r\nThe U.S. remains far behind on testing. (Statista).\r\nA screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated\r\n\r\n\u201CDeluge\u201D of cases begins hitting hospitals.\r\nCases and deaths rising rapidly. Only China shows some flattening of the curve. It proves it can be done, but it is not seen elsewhere.\r\nU.S. cases are still underestimated. Only more testing can provide the true story.\r\nThe Ugly\r\nBringing out the worst in some. Selling false cures on televangelist shows? Insider selling by political leaders? Testing provided to elites rather than those most in need?\r\n\r\nAs usual, I\u2019ll describe more of my own conclusions in today\u2019s Final Thought.\r\n\r\nQuant Corner and Risk Analysis\r\nI have a rule for my investment clients. Think first about your risk. Only then should you consider possible rewards. I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update, featuring the Indicator Snapshot.\r\n\r\nA screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated\r\n\r\nBoth long-term and short-term technical indicators continued at the lowest reading. The C-Score improved slightly, but it will now be used for a different purpose. It put us on recession warning last May, but the confirming coincident indicators never pushed us beyond the tossup level. Conditions are sufficiently clear that I expect an \u201Cofficial\u201D recession call from the NBER that will set the starting date some time this year. It will not be March, since the March data do not really meet the dating criteria. It takes a large and prolonged decine across the economy. It is certainly going to be a large decline, but prolonged will be a matter of judgement. We also might escape the tradition two negative quarter, say some economists. One data-driven firm still does not expect a recession this year.\r\n\r\nFor our purposes, none of this really matters. We will reset our thinking and let the C-Score work at helping us forecast the next cycle bottom.\r\n\r\nAs I have warned the last two weeks, the St. Louis Financial Stress Index is published on Thursday, using data from the prior Friday. We got the big increase I expected. Will we see another? It depends a lot on whether the Fed actions have calmed interest rate markets.\r\n\r\nI am treating forward earnings and the resulting measures as not meaningful until we get more clarity.\r\n\r\nI contine my rating of \u201CNeutral\u201D in the overall outlook since I would be neither a buyer nor a seller at this point. More on this in today\u2019s Final Thought.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Featured Sources:\r\nBob Dieli: Business cycle analysis via the \u201CC Score\u201D.\r\n\r\nBrian Gilmartin: All things earnings, for the overall market as well as many individual companies.\r\n\r\nDoug Short and Jill Mislinski: Regular updating of an array of indicators.\r\n\r\nGeorg Vrba: Business cycle indicator and market timing tools. The most recent update of Georg\u2019s business cycle index does not signal recession \u2013 at least under normal circumstances. He expects his unemployment recession indicator to signal recession with data from the next employment situation report.\r\n\r\nInsight for Investors\r\nTemporarily, I am suspending discussion of specific stocks and sectors in this section. More information and careful study are required.\r\n\r\nThe Great Rotation \u2013 Now the Great Reset\r\nThe current recession scare has halted (postponed?) the value portion of the Great Rotation. It has also affected small cap stocks which are generally perceived as more vulnerable financially. It is wise to change course when you get fresh data. My current best thought is to emphasize a Great Reset \u2013 with the best sectors and stocks for the post-pandemic era.\r\n\r\nFinal Thought\r\nAn important type of policy problem is what I have called the perception dichotomy. On one side of an issue the effects are specific, visible, dramatic, and provide an easy narrative. On the other side, the outcomes are no less real, but they lack the same tangibility. In the current pandemic, for example, hardly anyone understands the major benefit of a treatment that shortens a hospital stay from twenty days to fifteen days. It is massive. It is real. But you can only understand it through a model. Government assistance both to individuals is also hard to grasp. Many, including some noted economists, ask \u201Cwhere will people spend the money?\u201D This despite the daily stories of people who are losing jobs and have inadequate benefits. Which way is it? Once again, the impact is nearly impossible to gauge accurately. It requires a model, conclusions about concepts like \u201Cthe marginal propensity to consume,\u201D and the willingness to compare the result to the counterfactual of doing nothing. Try to make that into a narrative!\r\n\r\nMy approach to this problem involves actual, hands-on research.\r\n\r\nClose monitoring of the crisis and signs of curve-flattening.\r\nTracking scientific progress any many fronts, even if the news seems modest.\r\nCareful examination of every public action which could\r\nMitigate the spread of the virus;\r\nAid those affected the most; or\r\nProvide important economic stimulus.\r\nThere is a crucial opportunity before us, but not a need for haste.",

            "text": "The leap year is a fascinating quirk of the calendar, where every four years we see an extra day added to the shortest month of the year to keep the calendar well-aligned with the seasons. Investors could be excused for lamenting any extra time being added to this past month, as it was largely one many could not wait to see end.\r\n\r\nDo you remember impeachment? It was only on February 5th, just over one month ago, that President Trump was acquitted in the Senate, bringing to a close a four-month process. The markets had largely already priced in acquittal as the expected outcome, so the major indices were relatively muted in their reaction. In fact, following this news and some other developments that investors had been awaiting, including China\u2019s move to reduce tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. goods as of part of the recently signed trade agreement, both the S&P 500 and the Dow actually closed at new record highs on February 11th (Source: Bloomberg.com 2-11-20; Stocks Close at New High With Virus Concern Easing: Markets Wrap).\r\n\r\nThat now seems like decades ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe novel coronavirus had been lurking as a key concern since January, but as of the start of February had remained largely contained to China. That changed quickly, with cases emerging in Iran, South Korea, Italy, and a growing list of countries as the month moved along, until eventually it became clear that the virus had made its way to the U.S.\r\n\r\nThe last week of February saw some of the largest daily point declines in Dow Jones Industrial Average history, with a decline of 1,031 points on the 24th, 879 points on the 25th, a record 1,190 points on the 27th, before a 357 point drop mercifully took us into the weekend and that extra day of February on a Saturday.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the human toll, the coronavirus outbreak is likely to have a meaningfully negative impact on global economic output due to lower demand and supply chain disruptions. In our view, even as new cases are reported, we will need to see a slowdown in the rate of new cases worldwide before the market can begin to form a bottom.\r\n\r\nEquities also were not alone in experiencing elevated volatility amidst coronavirus concerns. High yield bonds sold off, and commodities continued their struggles. The IHS Markit Flash U.S. Composite PMI Output, released on February 21st, contracted for the first time since October 2013; Services Business Activity dropped to a 76-month low; and Manufacturing PMI dropped to its lowest level in 6 months, suggesting weakness across several key components of the U.S. economy.\r\n\r\nAs we noted in our January update, the volatility and headline risk which marked the first month of the New Year did not have the appearance of being an outlier. Investors need to continue their vigilance, in terms of their own health and the health of their portfolios. Diversification remains key, and alternative exposures designed to mitigate volatility while keeping investors exposed the potential recoveries, will continue to be a powerful tool in the face of all that has been happening, and all that may still be to come. Thankfully perhaps, we are back to having our usual requisite number of days for the rest of this so far turbulent year.\r\n\r\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results, which will vary.

            "title": "Keep Calm, Bear Markets Are Temporary",
            "text": "That was President Donald Trump on Monday, responding to a question on whether the U.S. economy could be sliding into a recession. I don\u2019t know about you, but I found this to be an extraordinary admission from the president, who until very recently has maintained an \u201Call will be fine\u201D attitude with regard to the spread of COVID-19 and its impact on the economy.\r\n\r\nWe may very well be headed for a recession\u2014some economists believe it\u2019s already here\u2014but we\u2019re most definitely in a bear market, normally defined as occurring when stocks are off more than 20 percent from their peak.\r\n\r\nNot only that, but this selloff has been several times steeper than the past two bear markets. Whereas it took stocks approximately 240 trading days to fall more than 20 percent during the tech bubble, and about 190 days during the financial crisis, U.S. equities lost more than 20 percent in under 20 trading days as a result of fears over the coronavirus. As of Tuesday\u2019s close, the S&P 500 was down 25 percent from its high on February 19.\r\n\r\nMarket selloff has been steeper than past two bear markets\r\n\r\nAs it happened, the Treasury market was warning us (again) all along. Most downturns of the past have been preceded by a yield curve inversion, which happens when the longer-term yield falls below the shorter-term yield, and this time was no exception. The chart below shows the 10-year Treasury yield minus the three-month Treasury yield. In each case, a recession hit in the months after the yield curve first inverted and began to recover.\r\n\r\nTreasury market was warning us all along...\r\n\r\nAwaiting Monetary and Fiscal Stimulus\r\nNow the question is what investors should do. It\u2019s been more than a decade since we\u2019ve had to deal with the unique challenges of a bear market, and there are countless millennials (and younger) to whom this is a brand new phenomenon.\r\n\r\nA couple of things to remember upfront: Don\u2019t panic. Bear markets can be painful, but they\u2019re temporary. More importantly, if you didn\u2019t raise cash in December or January, before the full effects of the virus began to be felt, it\u2019s probably too late to do so now. It may be a good time to do some bargain hunting for high-quality stocks right now, but generally speaking, I wouldn\u2019t be trying to sell equities.\r\n\r\nI understand the need for liquidity. That\u2019s one of the reasons why I always recommend having some physical gold in your portfolio, to convert into cash if needs be. The yellow metal just had its worst week since 2011 for that very reason, falling 9.3 percent as investors took profits amid the plunge in equities.\r\n\r\n\u201CRecessions have never been positive for gold,\u201D writes Dr. Martin Murenbeeld in this week\u2019s Gold Monitor. \u201CGold demand from China and India typically declines\u2026 and the need for liquidity also pressures the gold price\u2014gold being a liquidity of last resort.\u201D\r\n\r\nOn the plus side, says Martin, \u201Cthe price recovers quickly once the full force of policy responses are unleashed.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo what are those responses this time? While the Trump administration seeks as much as $850 billion in emergency stimulus, perhaps part of it in the form of $1,000 checks to every American adult, some are no doubt looking to the Federal Reserve for immediate relief. The problem is, the central bank is quickly running out of bullets.\r\n\r\nTake a look at the table below. Since 1969, the Fed has lowered rates 7.4 percent on average in response to recessionary pressure. Today, that\u2019s simply not possible\u2014unless, of course, the Fed took its lead from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and European Central Bank (ECB) and dropped rates below 0 percent.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Reserve Is Out of Ammo\r\n RECESSION\t TOTAL RATE CUTS\r\nDecember 1969 \u2013 November 1970\t-8.3%\r\nNovember 1973 \u2013 March 1975\t-8.1%\r\nJanuary 1980 \u2013 July 1980\t-11.0%\r\nJuly 1981 \u2013 November 1982\t-11.5%\r\nJuly 1990 \u2013 March 1991\t-3.0%\r\nMarch 2001 \u2013 November 2001\t-4.8%\r\nDecember 2007 \u2013 June 2009\t-5.0%\r\nAverage\t-7.4%\r\nSource: Federal Reserve, U.S. Global Investors\r\nPotentially Not as Bad as Past Downturns?\r\nIs every bear market cut from the same cloth? Hardly. In a research report, Goldman Sachs analysts break bear markets down into three different types: structural, cyclical and event-driven. Structural bear markets have been triggered by structural imbalances and financial bubbles\u2014think the global financial crisis. Cyclical bear markets have occurred at the end of business cycles\u2014they\u2019ve happened as a result of rising interest rates, impending recessions and\/or falling corporate profits. And finally, event-driven bear markets have been triggered by one-off shocks to the economy, such as wars, oil price crashes and emerging market crises.\r\n\r\nWe appear to be in an event-driven bear market, and the good news, from a financial point of view, is that of the three types, event-driven bear markets have historically been less severe than structural and cyclical downturns. Not only have declines been less painful, but they also haven\u2019t lasted as long and recovery times have been shorter.\r\n\r\nPeak gold supply is upon us\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of caveats I\u2019d like to point out, though. Number one, no bear market such as this has ever been triggered by a virus or other disease outbreak, according to Goldman Sachs, so we\u2019re literally in unchartered territory. (The U.S. market actually rose throughout most of the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 \u2013 1920, which killed tens of millions of people worldwide.) Therefore, we don\u2019t know if monetary or fiscal interventions, which may have helped ameliorate previous bear markets and recessions, will be as effective this time.\r\n\r\nAnd number two, there\u2019s always the risk that this event-driven bear market will become a cyclical bear market. As I\u2019ve shared with you a number of times before, we are 11 years into the economic expansion, with debt levels and leveraging at all-time highs. Meanwhile, the U.S. government is already running a $1 trillion deficit. This may limit the government\u2019s ability to prop up the economy should it come crashing down.\r\n\r\nThe Heat Is On for Trump\u2019s Reelection Bid\r\nAt the same time, it should calm markets somewhat to know that Trump has no other choice than to be highly motivated to soften the economic impact of COVID-19, which made landfall in the same year that he hopes to be reelected. No U.S. president in modern memory, going back at least to Eisenhower, has won a second term while there was a recession. Gerald Ford, his immediate successor Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush all lost their second-term bids in large part because the economy was on shaky ground when voters headed for the polls. In all other years when a president was seeking reelection, between 1956 and 2012, the economy was either expanding or at least stable.\r\n\r\nAs Democratic political strategist James Carville famously said, \u201CIt\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201D\r\n\r\nI believe that if we can substantially slow the rate of infection and flatten the curve, the economy will recover strongly, and stocks will follow. You\u2019ve probably seen the visual below being shared on social media a number of times already. Practicing social distancing can help level out the rate of new cases, preventing our health care system from being overwhelmed before a vaccine can be deployed.\r\n\r\nFlattening the curve\r\n\r\nFor those who are doubtful of these efforts, I think it\u2019s constructive to look at how successful China has been in combating the virus. The country has taken extreme measures, which has had the effect of lowering the number of existed cases on a daily basis for the past month. From February 17, when the number hit a high of more than 58,000, cases have fallen roughly 83 percent through March 15. This admittedly will have a big impact on China\u2019s first-quarter GDP growth, but it demonstrates that COVID-19 can be stopped in its tracks as long as there\u2019s a plan in place and precautionary measures are followed.\r\n\r\nNumber of existed confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China is dropping rapidly\r\n\r\nUp until this point, I\u2019ve mostly been talking finance. It\u2019s important to be concerned about your portfolio, but it\u2019s even more important to be vigilant about your health and the health of loved ones.

            "text": "Yes, it\u2019s true. The guy who has been warning of a risk-filled stock market for over 2 years is talking about the next bull market. What gives?\r\n\r\nYou see, investing is a continuous process. You should always be looking to do 3 things:\r\n\r\nGrow capital from a rising market\r\nHedge against major losses that threaten to impair that capital you made\r\nExploit periods of severe volatility\r\nOver the past decade, we have had plenty of the first one of those three items, and not much of the last two. Starting in late 2016, the global stock market gradually began to crack. But many investors had no idea, even though it was right in front of them.\r\n\r\nThe stock market \u201Churricane\u201D - in review\r\nThe fourth quarter of 2018 brought the first real test for investors in years. The S&P 500 fell just about 20%, most of that during a 3-week stretch in December. But the decline stopped on a dime on Christmas Eve, 2018. That led to a fierce rise in stock prices. Of course, that same narrow group of companies continued to lead the way.\r\n\r\nToday In: Markets\r\n\r\nThe S&P 500 has been hiding the stock market\u2019s gradual fade that entire time. Since that index and the Dow and Nasdaq favor a small number of prominent companies, as equity investing surged in popularity the past few years (a la the Dot-Com Bubble era), the details became less important to many people. As long as you had the FAANG stocks, those giant companies that dominate our modern daily lives, you didn\u2019t need to know anything else. Well, now you do.\r\n\r\nI have often used the metaphor of a hurricane to describe the U.S. stock market since late 2018. I view that quick decline that ended on Christmas Eve as the front part of the storm. 2019 and the first month of this year were the \u201CEye\u201D of the storm. That\u2019s the calm period during a hurricane when the weather is bright and sunny. You would have no idea that the back side of the storm is coming, unless you had a weather radar.\r\n\r\nPROMOTED\r\n\r\nGrads of Life BRANDVOICE\r\n | Paid Program\r\nDiscount Tire Employee Training Academies: Investing In The Future Workforce\r\nUNICEF USA BRANDVOICE\r\n | Paid Program\r\nUNICEF And Duke To Accelerate 6 Solutions For Better Menstrual Hygiene\r\nCivic Nation BRANDVOICE\r\n | Paid Program\r\nDon't Underestimate The Power Of The Muslim Woman\r\nThe back side of the storm arrived on February 19. The winds had been blowing a bit before that time, but the turning point was the S&P 500\u2019s topping out 4 weeks ago. Here is the S&P 500 in purple. This chart shows how it was the outlier for a while, as global stocks (MSCI ACWI) and small caps (Russell 2000) had already peaked a couple of years ago, but for some brief rallies.\r\n\r\n.\r\n^SPX_^MSACWI_^RUT_chart YCHARTS.COM\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent conditions\r\nThat\u2019s the history. I will continue to write to you about how I progress to navigate that vicious storm. After all, I believe that, despite the likelihood of some strong bounces, this will get worse before it gets consistently better.\r\n\r\nI am not a market timer. I do constantly evaluate probabilities. I always have a stance on what and where return potential is, and how much risk is required to pursue that return. Right now, as much as dip-buyers want to pounce on stocks, I say that\u2019s fine. You just have to accept the potential to see your new holdings drop by a breath-taking amount. Yes, that\u2019s always a possibility in the stock market. But that is the case now more than in \u201Cnormal\u201D times.\r\n\r\nI literally cannot find a single stock that I would take a \u201Cfull\u201D long-term position in at this juncture. That has been the case for a while now. That alone is a market indicator to me. It was a big factor in my sounding the alarm about a severe downturn in stocks earlier this year. That condition has not changed yet. Until it does, stock investing will be a volatile pastime.\r\n\r\nRemember, despite the recent selloff, even the S&P 500 sits right near the top of the mountain. Here is what the past 25 years have looked like. In particular, note that bear markets and recessions (the 2 gray shaded periods) have resulted in the market giving back way more gains than this one has in its first few weeks.\r\n\r\n.\r\n^SPX_chart (1) YCHARTS.COM\r\nBUT: I didn\u2019t say not to invest in stocks\r\nFor many investors, there is always a reason to be buying stocks. After all, we never know anything for sure in this business. That\u2019s why every investment ad has such a long disclaimer below it!\r\n\r\nStill, we can always look ahead to better times, and do so with discipline, not emotion. For today, here is a short list of things you can start to work on to give your portfolio a great chance to be present and accounted for when that next bull market in stocks gets rolling.\r\n\r\nDevelop a short list of blue chip stocks you would be willing to take a full position in \"at a price.\"  \r\nOr, if you prefer to invest in ETF or mutual funds, make a list of those instead. For instance, I am current developing a list of potential long-term stock holdings, based on the same Yield at a Reasonable Price (YARP) methodology I have used in the past.\r\n\r\nWhile few, if any stocks are \"cheap\" in an environment like this, there are several that are starting to get more reasonably valued. That\u2019s enough to at least consider adding them into the portfolio in small \"waves\" at a time.  This is akin to dollar-cost-averaging, except that it will not be done at set calendar intervals. That reward\/risk trade-off I mentioned above is what guides this.\r\n\r\nWhy the focus on blue chip stocks, the business leaders of today? Because regardless of how much you love to buy smaller company stocks, you are fighting a bigger uphill battle than at any time I can remember. There is too much price-insensitive investing going on (algorithmic traders and index funds) to fight that tide.\r\n\r\nIt creates an environment of \u201Crisk-on \/ risk-off\u201D that reduces the ability to stock-pick outside of the larger companies. That forces us to simplify our equity investing, at least when it comes to the central part of our stock portfolio. That change may be permanent, we\u2019ll see.\r\n\r\nCreate a \"fallen angels\" list\r\nAgain, this can be stocks or funds. The common denominator is that you are looking for severe price dislocations. These are companies or market sectors that are way, way out of favor.  They might even be priced as if they could go out of business.  But if you think you have an edge, make that list and monitor them. But realize that there is bigger risk here than in any part of your portfolio. So allocate accordingly.\r\n\r\nI always maintain a list of fallen angels. It is about 20-25 stocks. It has been a long time since I have plucked one off the list and put it in the portfolio. But when everything starts to go on sale, we inch closer to at least some of them being buy-able.\r\n\r\nLearn to use options as a surrogate for buying (or shorting) securities\r\nOptions have a mysterious, eclectic reputation in some circles. What I am talking about is a \u201Cmeat and potatoes\u201D approach to options. That is, simply looking at any investment you might make, and determining whether you want to go \u201Call-in\u201D at the start. One way to give yourself return potential, but with downside risk limited to an amount you define up front, is to use options.\r\n\r\nThis space does not permit me to go into the level of detail required. So for now, suffice it to say that options can be a surrogate for committing a larger amount of capital to an investment. And, using options is not mutually exclusive with investing in stocks or ETFs themselves. That is, they can be used in tandem. At a strange time like this, perhaps thinking outside the box is a good thing!\r\n\r\nGetting back on the proverbial horse\r\nThese 3 ideas may be used separately or together to get your portfolio back in shape, if you have taken a hit recently. However, the most important aspect of this is to have a consistent process of constantly evaluating investments. That process does not change at all from bull market to bear market. The only thing that changes is how many \u201Cgood ideas\u201D are revealed by your process.\r\n\r\nIf your process was soundly built, you probably have not had too many good new ideas lately. Perhaps soon that will start to happen again. That\u2019s when you know that the bear market is progressing back toward bull market for stocks. And, that the storm is fading.",

            "title": "Should You Really Buy Stocks Now or Wait a While Longer?",
            "text": "Anyone who lived through the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 knows that the turmoil during that period presented a fantastic opportunity to buy stocks. Not everyone realized it at the time, though. There was a lot of fear and trepidation about what could happen next.\r\n\r\nIt's a similar story today. Most investors probably realize that the stock market crash caused by the coronavirus pandemic will in retrospect be one of the best opportunities to buy stocks in a generation. But that still doesn't make it easy. As was the case during the financial crisis more than a decade ago, no one knows for sure what might happen next.\r\n\r\nShould you really buy stocks now? Would it be smarter to wait a while longer? Here are the answers to those pressing questions.\r\n\r\nSlips of paper with words printed for different levels of urgency, including \"now,\" \"someday,\" \"later,\" \"another day,\" and \"next week\"\r\nIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.\r\n\r\nKnown knowns and unknowns\r\nWhatever you think about former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, he said something in 2002 that I think is applicable to what's going on now. Rumsfeld stated, \"There are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say, we know there are some things we do not know.\"\r\n\r\nWhat are the known knowns for investors? One is that we know the U.S. hasn't seen the worst yet in terms of COVID-19 cases. Based on the experiences of other countries that were hit by the coronavirus outbreak earlier, the next month or two could bring more bad news than good news.\r\n\r\nBut, more importantly, we also know that the challenges are temporary. The numbers of new COVID-19 cases in China have dwindled. That will happen in the U.S. also. The economy will bounce back once the fears about the pandemic subside.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are known unknowns. We don't know, for example, exactly how long it will take for the wave of COVID-19 diagnoses to diminish. We don't know how much a government stimulus package will help. And no one knows for sure if the stock market will continue fall and, if so, by how much.\r\n\r\nNow or later?\r\nAll of that might seem confusing, but I think it's helpful in answering the question of whether or not you should buy stocks now or wait a while. Actually, my view is that considering the known knowns and unknowns should give investors confidence in making the right decision.\r\n\r\nBased on the known knowns, buying stocks right now is a good idea for investors with a long-term perspective. Knowing that the U.S. and global economies will rebound should allow you to buy stocks and feel good that you'll make solid returns over the next decade.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, those known unknowns make it apparent that keeping some cash on the sidelines to invest later is also a prudent move. We don't know how long the coronavirus crisis will last or how much more the stock market might decline. Having money to buy stocks at potentially even cheaper prices makes sense.\r\n\r\nThe right answer to the question, therefore, of should you really buy stocks now or wait a while longer is \"do both.\" Stagger your investments over the next several weeks and months. This approach should improve your chances of winning over the long run.\r\n\r\nAn even more important question\r\nBut there's an even more important question that investors should be asking: Which stocks should I buy? I think there's a nuanced answer to this question.\r\n\r\nIf you're retired, probably the best course of action is to buy dividend stocks that now have much juicier yields thanks to the stock market crash. AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is one of my favorite dividend stocks to buy right now. Its dividend yield stands at a mouth-watering 6.6%. The company has lost close to one-fourth of its market cap during the stock market sell-off, but patients will need its drugs regardless of what happens with the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\nA lot of investors are looking for dirt cheap bargain stocks to buy. You can get both a bargain and a sky-high dividend yield with Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD). Shares of the midstream energy company have plunged more than 50%, driving its dividend yield to a sky-high 12.3%. It could take a while for the stock to recover, though. Oil and gas stocks have fallen because of an oil price war in addition to the coronavirus outbreak. However, for long-term investors, Enterprise Products Partners looks like a steal right now.\r\n\r\nMy favorite approach is to incrementally buy shares of stocks with tremendous growth prospects that are now cheaper than they've been in a while. I really like Guardant Health (NASDAQ:GH). The stock has fallen more than 25%. But the company's liquid biopsy products have a massive opportunity in diagnosing cancer at early stages and monitoring for cancer recurrence.\r\n\r\nThose are just a few examples of stocks that should be smart long-term picks. Invest some of your money now, more of it in a couple of weeks, and then continue to buy over the next few months. As was the case in 2008 and 2009, fortunes will be made as a result of the opportunity investors will have during the current crisis.",

            "text": "The coronavirus pandemic has quickly thrust the world into recession as bars and restaurants shut down and countries instruct their citizens to hunker down. The question now is just how deep the pain will be, and how long it will last.\r\nA picture of the economic devastation in North America and Europe has already started to emerge. A US government report published Thursday showed that 281,000 Americans filed for their first week of unemployment benefits last week \u2014 a sudden 33% jump over the week before and the largest percentage increase since 1992.\r\n\r\nThis week is expected to be much worse. Goldman Sachs predicts that a shocking 2.25 million Americans will have filed for their first week of unemployment benefits. That would be eight times the number of people who filed last week and the highest level on record.\r\nCoronavirus could spark another Great Depression, former Trump adviser warns \r\nCoronavirus could spark another Great Depression, former Trump adviser warns\r\nWatch this space: The investment bank thinks the US unemployment rate will shoot up from an all-time low of 3.5% to 9% \"over the next couple of quarters.\"\r\nFears about joblessness on this scale could jolt markets again. Investors have priced in a recession by now, but may still be processing the size of the hole the coronavirus has blown into the global economy, Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told me.\r\n\"The market is expecting bad data,\" he said, but the jobs numbers may be \"far worse\" than investors think.\r\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 35% from its all-time high in mid-February, erasing all its gains since President Donald Trump's inauguration. Between January 20 and last Thursday, $27 trillion was wiped off global stocks, according to Bank of America.\r\nAnd there's still no nadir in sight, especially as dismal economic data from Europe and North America begins to roll in.\r\n\"[The market is] unlikely to bottom until we see the peak in new virus cases, and we just don't know when that will be,\" Kleintop said. \"We don't have anything for the market to hold onto to steady it.\"\r\nFearful of devastating layoffs in the travel and hospitality industries, governments are taking radical steps to support businesses. The United Kingdom on Friday pledged to pay 80% of wages, up to \u00A32,500 ($2,895) per month, for employees who can't work because of the pandemic.\r\nThat could help: Economists are hopeful that such dramatic measures can ease some of the pain. Capital Economics believes that in the United Kingdom, unemployment will now rise from 4% to 6%, instead of to 8% as had been \"previously feared.\"\r\n\"Providing cash-strapped firms with generous subsidies to retain their staff will dramatically lower the risk of surging unemployment during the coronavirus recession,\" Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg Bank, told clients Friday. And it \"raises the chance that the economy can get back to normal quickly\" once restrictions are lifted, he added.\r\nThe 30 days that brought the world to the brink of depression\r\nMonday, February 17. The novel coronavirus outbreak is raging in China, but fewer than 1,000 people have been infected outside the country. With the virus out of sight and mostly out of mind, the Dow stands just shy of 30,000 points, driven by the longest US economic expansion in history.\r\n30 days that brought the world to the brink of a depression\r\n30 days that brought the world to the brink of a depression\r\nWhat investors couldn't know is that over the next 30 days, the coronavirus would burst out of quarantine in China, with major outbreaks in South Korea and Italy, then Spain, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. It brought business to a sudden stop, sent stock markets into a meltdown and forced central banks to take emergency action on a scale even greater than during the 2008 global financial crisis.\r\nWhere we stand: A global recession, once unthinkable in 2020, is now a foregone conclusion, and some experts warn that the pandemic could drag the world's economy into a depression. And the coronavirus outbreak may just be getting started.\r\nCentral banks and governments have unleashed a tsunami of interest rate cuts, loan guarantees and new spending, tapping emergency powers to reassure investors, cushion the shock to companies and workers and preserve the foundations of a functioning economy for the future. Yet the rescue efforts may already be too late.\r\n\"In the worst case, entire industries could be destroyed,\" the credit ratings agency Moody's told clients on Friday.\r\nRead the full story from my CNN Business colleague Charles Riley here.",

            "text": "America\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) was $21.4 billion last year. If it resets down between 12% and 13% this year, the figure will go back to the $18.7 level of 2016. Of course, GDP will be produced in different ways than it was four years ago.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the 2016 and 2020 figures is based on a 20% drop in the second quarter of this year, followed by 10% in the third and between a 5% drop and flat in the fourth quarter of 2020. It also assumes that the spread of the coronavirus will hit 15% of the U.S. population, will peak in late May and the rise in infection per week fall to zero by August.\r\n\r\n\r\nParts of the hospitality industry may fall off of over 50% in the second quarter and slowly recover throughout the rest of the year. It represents 3% of the U.S.\r\n\r\nRetail could reset down 10%, with bricks and mortar sales off closer to 20% and e-commerce moving up to 30% or better. Unfortunately, e-commerce sales have traditionally been less than a quarter of total retail sales dollars. The industry is about 16% of the American economy.\r\n\r\nManufacturing is harder to gauge because it encompasses aircraft manufacturing and the automotive business. This entire sector is a third of the American economy, or $7 trillion. Airplane building could drop 50% for the year, with much of it coming in the March to September period. Car sales could drop by 20% based on industry experts. Again, most of it will come in the early part of the year. The biggest danger to aircraft builders is that airlines are slow to get back to near normal, and then hold older planes for a longer time than usual.\r\n\r\nConstruction is 7% of the American economy. Home and commercial space construction may continue into the second quarter after projects begun in the first quarter are competed. The drop in the second and third quarters could decrease by 40% to 50% as homes go unsold and demand for office and retail space nearly disappears in the middle of the year.\r\n\r\nState and local government are 9% of GDP, and may not fall at all. Possibly, the number of people in this sector could grow as the need for the government to manage the disease rises.\r\n\r\nThe financial part of the economy, which is 8% of GDP may only be affected in the first half. Bank branches will lay off people. The institutional part of the business may see a sharp rise later in the year, as lending and personal bank activity moves back to more normal levels.\r\n\r\nHealth and social care are 8% of the economy. GDP of this sector is likely to rise. It could move higher by 10% to 15% as hospitals and related care centers need more and more people.\r\n\r\nThe federal government is 5% of GDP. It may be flat for the entire year, as the healthcare and financial parts of the economy require support at rising levels.\r\n\r\nWhat will the economy look like in 2021, if there is full recovery to 2019 levels? Retail and manufacturing may not recover for years. Health care GDP could stay at a higher level indefinitely. Government activity will remain flat or rising. Construction will recover as pent up demand for homes and buildings moves to make up for lost construction in the past three quarters of 2020. Retail and service, particularly hospitality, may take years to rebound.\r\n\r\nSome parts of the U.S. economy will be depressed for half a decade or more. E-commerce, government, and health care will drive the economy.",

            "text": "The markets, both bond and equities, cannot get out of their way fast enough.\r\n\r\nBalances and counterbalances that have held for years no longer hold.\r\n\r\nI am a fan of closed-end funds, as is generally known.\r\n\r\nThe closed-end fund group will raise their leverage limits, if necessary, long before they will stop paying their dividends. Though it is also fair to say that some dividends may be cut in the meantime.\r\n\r\n\"The time to buy is when there is blood in the streets. Even if it is your own.\"\r\n\r\n- Baron Rothschild\r\n\r\nWell, I am sitting on the gutter in America. I am watching the stuff slide underneath my feet. Mark Grant is telling you, \"There is blood in the streets.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a medical crisis, which has become a health crisis, and which has enlarged further into a financial crisis. We are in the thick of it. We are surrounded by it, as we are all directed to \"shelter in place.\" We are caught, surrounded, and glued, resolutely, into a very small personal space now. We cannot get out of our own way because various governmental entities here, and in the rest of the world, will not allow us to do so. We are trapped.\r\n\r\nGet this into your mind: Trapped.\r\n\r\nThe markets, both bond and equities, cannot get out of their way fast enough. Balances and counterbalances that have held for years no longer hold. The hedge of yesterday has become the speculation of today, and almost no one is even aware of the change that has taken place. The reliance upon the experience of the past has become moot. New methodologies of thinking must now take hold. New strategies must be put into place. Listen up, before your ears get caught in the cycle of old, that will not, not, not, determine the future.\r\n\r\nThe governments of the world are now caught in a quagmire. Is the needle threaded by the health of their citizens or the health of their economies. It is a fine line between doomsday and crawling out of this mess and governments, being whom they are, will make promises to us at every turn, in the hopes of some kind of medical resolution, or political resolution, which will not be soon forthcoming. Money can't cure what money can't buy and pandemics are not based upon fiscal concerns. We can throw money against the wall and hope, but money, alone, cannot cure our present situation.\r\n\r\nThis is a horse of a different color, as the Wizard of Oz once, correctly, surmised. The first and foremost hope is a vaccine that will cure the coronavirus. However, there is not one in sight and likely not one that will be arriving any day soon. You will hear rumors of one, there will be bold statements made that one is coming, any day now. I am told, by several highly placed people in the medical profession, however, that I know, to keep my hopes in line with reality. Things are in the wind, but nothing is on the table.\r\n\r\nTherefore, various governments are doing what they can, which is to toss out lifelines to those that get caught by this deadly beast. There is really not much else that they can do, at this point, and so I do not criticize them, for doing what they can. Having placed people's health at the top of the woodpile we must then look next at the markets, to try to determine how to deal with a medical emergency that we have not really witnessed since the Bubonic Plague in the thirteenth century. In my opinion, that is how far we have to go back, to assess the severity of the situation.\r\n\r\nThat far back!\r\n\r\nOne good thing that I see, eventually, coming out of our mess, is a change of attitudes. Fine, China, and other Asian nations, may make pharmaceuticals or whizz-bang parts, or electronics cheaper and that has been the overwhelming consideration to date. I think this will change and dramatically, as America, and other countries, and their corporations, place safety over cost. Fine, it costs a few extra bucks to be made in America, and purchased in America, but that will become a Hell of a lot better now than any type of exposure to viruses and other health issues. Manufacturing, in my view, is going to become way more American centric and that will be a positive for U.S. companies, a very real positive, in the longer term.\r\n\r\nThe trick then, as in all financial crises, is not to panic. Fortunes are going to be lost in our present financial quandary and the main issue for all of us, personally, or for our businesses, is that it is not \"our\" financial fortune, that is lost, whatever we may have accumulated.\r\n\r\nHaving some cash now is fine. However, the majority of the cash should be waiting for the massive opportunities, which will be presented, in the days ahead. This is not the time to stuff it all in a drawer, never to be taken out. \"Preservation of Capital\" always rules but sometimes that means buying at lower prices, and higher yields, to lock-in your initial investment for later gains. Patience, good old common sense, which is never that common, and an eye to the future will determine where to go and how to get there. This is not a time for \"appreciation plays, in my estimation, but for \"cash flows,\" that will hold you in place. The time for appreciation moves will come later. The time for \"cash flows,\" and income streams, is NOW!\r\n\r\nSome entire industries, in my view, will not survive in their present form. They may be around in some form, but not in the way that they are constructed presently. I point specifically to cruise lines, hotels, the travel industry, in general, restaurant chains, bars, retail shops, property and casualty companies full of business interruption insurance, shopping malls, where, even after the coronavirus gets hopefully cured, will leave an indelible mark upon our psyches which will demand more personal space and more personal safety. The virus of today could transform itself into the new virus of tomorrow and people will expect businesses to overtly be prepared for this possibility, before they interact. What was not thought of before, must be thought of now.\r\n\r\nI am a fan of closed-end funds, as is generally known. They have large portfolios so that one or two companies, cancelling their dividends, does not bend you over, all by themselves. I like the closed-end funds that pay monthly and the double digit dividend, that you were delighted with before, may now be 1.5 times, two times or even more now. Choose wisely but there are opportunities that can be taken here. Also, leg money in. No \"Hail Mary\" passes.\r\n\r\nThese funds are not like ETFs, or many mutual funds, where forced selling is now on the table. Of the funds that I like, none are that close to the statutory leverage limits of fifty percent. Consequently, in my opinion, the closed-end fund group will raise their leverage limits, if necessary, long before they will stop paying their dividends, though it is also fair to say that some dividends may be cut, in the meantime. However, starting with a double digit yield will also help to curtail the pain.\r\n\r\nBonds are also an interesting play now. They have gapped out, and out, and out, against Treasuries. I am not particularly taken with the methodology of the rating agencies, these days. Their criteria is now, in my view, based upon standards which no longer exist. You have to do your own homework, look at the industry they are in, and then look at the leverage. It is assets, as compared with liabilities, and the leverage, in both, that will determine which bonds may ultimately succeed or fail. Just forget the rating now. Look hard at the numbers.\r\n\r\nI said earlier that \"Fortunes would be lost.\" I am also here to tell you that \"Fortunes will be made,\" in our present circumstances. When the financial markets are bent this far out of shape, something that has not occurred in this century, with the possible exception of the Great Depression, in my opinion, then many will fall, but a few will rise from the ashes.\r\n\r\nBetter to be a Phoenix, than a slaughtered Bull or Bear.\r\n\r\nEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",

The funding should be provided by the Federal Reserve and\/or the Treasury (they must partner on this).\r\n\r\nThe businesses should receive two months\u2019 worth of traditional deposits, based on an average of their deposits over the past year. The equity injection would mandate that the business rehire the same employees and gig workers it had prior to the coronavirus outbreak \u2014 in the event it does not, the money becomes a loan due to the Federal government.\r\n\r\nSEE ALSO \r\n\r\nAn Rx to calm America's coronavirus panic\r\nAlso, let\u2019s have all of the banks offer to re-strike mortgages at today\u2019s lower rates if no payments have been missed in last six to 12 months. No lengthy paperwork, no lawyers, no expenses for the consumer.\r\n\r\nThe banks are just the pass- through here \u2014 all banks or mortgage investors will be kept whole by the government, which would reimburse the mortgage servicer or bank for funds lost due to the rate reduction. Nothing changes except the interest rate. Yes, people could refinance on their own, but it\u2019s a cumbersome and very costly process.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, let\u2019s retrofit empty hotels into hospital overflow treatment centers. That will help hotels and their workers, who can be employed there in support capacities. And the retrofitted buildings will be a valuable long-term asset in the event of another national emergency.\r\n\r\nEach of these can be done quickly and directly, precisely where needed.\r\n\r\nWashington, vote your country today. Vote politics in November.\r\n\r\nView it as economic triage.",

            "text": "After just a few days of financial\/economic chaos, I long for the worry I had just a couple of weeks ago that there was growing softness in the U.S. and world economies. That\u2019s now just a distant memory. Most of the recent data is pre-virus, and are generally meaningless. The numbers we will get for March will be awful, but the worst is yet to come. An example of March\u2019s data is from the Philly Fed. The print of their Manufacturing Index was -12.7 for March, down a record amount from the +36.7 in February.  Initial jobless claims for the week ending March 14 (281k) were up 33% from the prior week. This number will get worse, much worse.\r\n\r\nQ2 GDP growth will be more negative than any of us have ever seen in our lifetimes. You already know the reasons: a significant percentage of small businesses dealing with the public are shut-down or partially so, and larger (essential) businesses are working with reduced staff or staff working from home. The hardest hit industries are in the travel and leisure space (airlines, hotels, restaurants, casinos, movie theaters, convention and meeting space\u2026 The list goes on and on).\r\n\r\nRecession with a Capital \u201CR\u201D\r\n\r\nIt shouldn\u2019t be a surprise to anyone that the Recession started this month, March. Note that I capitalized the \u201CR\u201D word, as this one is going to be faster and deeper than any since the Depression. And, it may rival that. Q2 GDP growth is going to be negative double digits, like -15% or -20%. As outlined above, small businesses are directly impacted, and one can only hope that the fiscal plans being discussed in D.C. adequately include this business segment, else the recovery will be slower than anyone has yet discussed.\r\n\r\nInfection Control\r\n\r\nThe depth and duration of this Recession is going to depend on infection control. In China, the original cases began in December (they didn\u2019t tell the world until late January), and, from the time they quarantined in January, it was about 45 days till their daily infection rate (new cases) declined. In the U.S., once we get enough test kits and get a handle on how many existing cases there are, the key to the length and depth of the Recession will be determined when the daily count of new cases falls on a consistent day-to-day basis. (Hopefully, if we repeat what China did (or better yet, Korea), the case counts will begin falling in late April.)\r\n\r\nToday In: Markets\r\n\r\nLiquidity, Liquidity, Liquidity\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the financial markets are in a chaotic state, with liquidity a huge issue. In a Recession, equity prices always fall. And the contraction is between 20% and 50% depending on the recession\u2019s perceived length and depth. Since no one currently has a handle on either of those two parameters, we get 1000+ point swings in the DJIA on a daily basis (down, then up, but more downs). \r\n\r\nPROMOTED\r\n\r\nCivic Nation BRANDVOICE\r\n | Paid Program\r\nWe Need Student Organizers, Not Just Student Voters\r\nUNICEF USA BRANDVOICE\r\n | Paid Program\r\nKeeping Children And Schools Safe Protects Us All\r\nGrads of Life BRANDVOICE\r\n | Paid Program\r\nDiscount Tire Employee Training Academies: Investing In The Future Workforce\r\nOne big difference in this bear market is that bond prices, which should be going up (and yields down) have also been falling. They took a breather on Friday, March 20, when Treasuries rallied and Corporates stabilized, as the Fed was in the market. In the 10 days to March 18, the yield on 10-Year T-Notes rose at an unprecedented rate (0.34% to 1.25%). Consumer rates, which are often tied to the 10-Year have risen .6 pct. points on auto loans and mortgage backed securities, .6 to .9 pct. points on home equity loans, 1.0 pct. point on muni bonds, and 1.2 pct. points on credit cards.\r\n\r\nIn the corporate bond space, the spreads between investment grade corporates and the same maturity Treasury widened from 1.06 pct. points on February 19 to 3.08 pct. points on March 18. High yield corporate spreads went from 3.45 pct. points to 8.88 over the same period.\r\n\r\nThe Panic of 2020\r\n\r\nIn a recession, interest rates always fall. The Fed cut the Fed Funds rate essentially to 0% in an emergency FOMC meeting on Sunday, March 15. Given these, why are rates rising?\r\n\r\nHere are some reasons:\r\n\r\nThe most rapid fall in equity prices in history caused margin calls for those who had borrowed to partake in the market uptrend that ended on February 19. These are mainly hedge funds. When this occurs, there is a need to sell, and, with no one buying (at least not anywhere near an acceptable price), fund managers and other shorts are forced to sell their most liquid assets, i.e., Treasury Notes and Bonds.\r\nPanic selling of mutual funds and ETFs had a similar impact. Here are some data: Investment grade bond funds saw $35.6 billion in redemptions this past week, handily beating the $7.3 billion previous record set the prior week. The outflows from high yield funds, another record, were $11.9 billion. And emerging market funds lost $18.8 billion (you guessed right \u2013 another record).\r\nAs a result, safe havens, like Treasuries, had to be sold to meet the record redemptions (that no one was prepared for).\r\nMarkets are also worried as there is no visibility as to revenues, costs, etc. at the corporate level; thus, better to shoot now and ask questions later (i.e., sell, sell, sell).\r\nSuch behavior is highly unusual, but not unprecedented. It happens during times of panic selling. Economist David Rosenberg recently outlined four instances over the last 22 years of similar behavior (but not to this extent). The table below uses the 30-Year Treasury Bond (the \u201CLong\u201D Bond) behavior to show initial levels, panic levels, and the ultimate level after the panic had passed.\r\n\r\nLong bond Yield\r\nBehavior of the Long Bond Yield BARONE\r\nIt should be noted that the table shows the impact of such panics on the Treasury Long Bond. Corporations do not borrow at Treasury interest rates. It depends on their credit rating. At present, with little in the way of visibility for the corporate sector, and as long as the country is in lock-down mode, the spreads of even high quality corporate paper to the Treasury yield curve will stay wider than they were before all this began. Even when some semblance of \u201Cnormalcy\u201D returns, it is unlikely that they will narrow back to where they were in February. That doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t bargains out there; at least for those investors bold enough to take advantage.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s Up To The Fed To Calm The Markets\r\n\r\nThe Recession will only get worse if interest rates rise! So, it\u2019s up to the Fed to calm the credit markets, and they initially tried to do that by moving the Fed Funds rate to 0%. While many commentators now say the Fed is \u201Cout of bullets\u201D because they are at the 0% rate bound, that simply isn\u2019t true. The Fed has a balance sheet that can grow to unlimited size (via QE). There are other methods too, like buying corporate paper or munis. Technically, Congress must approve these, but on Friday, March 20, the Fed found a way around this and purchased assets in the muni market. \r\n\r\nDuring World War II and in the post-WWII period (1942-1951) the Fed targeted yields. The yield on the Long Bond was targeted at 2.50%; and the Fed hardly had to intervene to purchase or sell, as the credit markets enforced the Fed\u2019s dictum (now that\u2019s called \u201Ccredibility\u201D). The Fed still has this tool in its toolbox to control the yield curve, and, it is my guess that they will employ it.\r\n\r\nThe Attack on American Oil\r\n\r\nTo make economic matters even worse, there is an ongoing attack on America\u2019s shale oil industry by Saudi Arabia (SA) and the Russians. The price\/bbl. of oil was less than $20 (West Texas Intermediate (WTI)) on March 18th (it was $52+ on February 23). It has since risen, closing at $23.64 on March 20 due to some remarks by the President about intervention. The price has fallen out of bed because along with the rapid falloff in demand caused by the virus, SA decided not only to release its OPEC partners from the 2.1 million bbl. per day reduction that had been in place for quite some time, but to produce more. The $20\/bbl. price is significantly under the cost of production in America\u2019s shale industry, whereas the cost of production in SA is only about $9\/bbl. While this is not a prime Recession mover, it will add to America\u2019s pain, as production workers in America\u2019s shale areas are laid off.\r\n\r\nFiscal Stimulus\r\n\r\nOne last issue remains: how much fiscal stimulus will there be, will it be sufficient, will it be properly targeted, and will it arrive on time? The answer is likely \u201Cno\u201D initially, but, eventually, the politicians will get it right (at least that is our hope). Right now, they are talking $1.3 trillion. Likely, that isn\u2019t going to be enough. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the Treasury should issue the equivalent of \u201CWar Bonds\u201D (which later became \u201CSavings Bonds\u201D), like they did during World War II. These had long maturities. The Treasury, through the banking system, sold them directly to the public. If they were to issue these today at an attractive interest rate (say 2.50%), the Baby Boomers would likely flock to them.\r\n\r\nConclusions (i.e., Questions Still to be Answered)\r\n\r\nUncertainty regarding the length and depth of the Recession, except we know it will be awful;\r\nThe added issue of the attack on America\u2019s shale oil producers;\r\nThe panic in the equity markets; will the fiscal stimulus allay market fears, i.e., will there be sufficient federal aid to impacted businesses, like airlines (Boeing?), hotels, casinos, municipalities? What about small businesses?\r\nThe seemingly contradictory rise in bond yields; will corporate bond yields follow the lead of the Treasury curve and fall from their current panic mode levels?\r\nWhile the Fed has the tools to combat the liquidity issues, will they use them in time?\r\nWhat is going to happen to the yields on the debt of corporations with high debt levels or those rated junk?",

That\u2019s despite the US dollar, which is historically strong.\r\n\r\nFriday, the Ag Fund ETF DBA, coffee and sugar all closed green.\r\n\r\nSilver, at a historical 80 year low against gold, narrowed that ratio closing up 3% versus gold up 2%.\r\n\r\nSilver also rose 3% in the face of SPY which closed down nearly 5%\r\n\r\nHigh Yield Investment Grade Bonds LQD, broke down to 2010 lows. \r\n\r\nGiven that the 2020 crisis, although looks different than the Nixon shock of 1971, or the wars (WW1, WW2, Vietnam, Iraq), we have a new crisis, or really a slew of them.\r\n\r\nThis suggests a very high probability we will see the PPI rise, while the SPY continues to decline.\r\n\r\nIn the words of Mae West, \u201COne and one is two; two and two is four; and \u2018five will get you ten\u2019 if you work it right.\u201D \r\n\r\nS&P 500 (SPY) The low 228.02 from 3\/18 held marginally-now key \r\n\r\nRussell 2000 (IWM) Until this clears 110-noise.

As the coronavirus strain, COVID-19, swept across the planet, today may go down in history as the day when huge numbers of countries were largely united in a global shut-down to address the pandemic.\r\n\r\nTechCrunch brings you a wrap of the technology world\u2019s response to the virus so far in our own dedicated COVID-19 coverage.\r\n\r\n\u2022 In Extra Crunch we cover how you should pitch a story in the era of COVID-19.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Google says coronavirus has become its biggest search topic by a country mile this year, and to continue its efforts to harness that attention in the best possible way, late on Friday the company launched a new information portal dedicated to the pandemic as well as an improved search experience for desktop and mobile.\r\n\r\n\u2022 In response to COVID-19, Hulu has added a free live news stream to its on-demand app for customers who only subscribe to its on-demand service, not its live TV add-on. The news coverage is provided in partnership with ABC News Live, and brings live news 24\/7 to Hulu on-demand subscribers as part of their existing subscription.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Unfortunately, \u201CRobocalls\u201D, which have been targeting the vulnerable and unsuspecting for years, are taking advantage of the current global catastrophe to enhance their scams. The FCC warns that it has received numerous reports of coronavirus-related robocall cons in the wild \u2014 here\u2019s what to look for.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Two major tech companies \u2014 Amazon and IBM \u2014 have each announced programs to encourage developers to find solutions to a variety of problems related to the pandemic.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Google announced on Twitter that it is cancelling its annual I\/O developer conference out of concern for the health and safety of all involved. It will not be holding any online conference in its place either.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Rivian, the buzzy electric vehicle startup that is backed by Amazon and Ford, is shutting down all of its facilities due to the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus. Rivian employs more than 2,000 workers across several locations, including its headquarters in Plymouth, Mich., a factory in Normal, Ill. as well as operations in San Jose and Irvine, Calif., where engineers are working on autonomous vehicle technology. Rivian also has an office in the U.K.\r\n\r\n\u2022 During two of this week\u2019s White House briefings, President Trump referred specifically to two potential treatments that have been identified by medical researchers and clinicians. But no drugs or treatments have been proven as effective for either the prevention of contracting COVID-19 or for its treatment. While chloroquine has been used for decades to treat malaria, and chronic rheumatoid arthritis, it can have dangerous side effects, including death, if taken incorrectly. Even when taken correctly, it can cause things like stomach distress and even permanent damage to a person\u2019s vision.\r\n\r\n\u2022 The COVID-19 outbreak isn\u2019t just affecting movie theaters \u2014 it has also halted TV and film production around the world. For Netflix, that has included production on high-profile titles like \u201CThe Witcher\u201D and \u201CStranger Things.\u201D So the streaming company just announced that it has created a $100 million fund that it says will support the cast and crew who have suddenly found themselves out of work.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Elon Musk tweeted Friday that Tesla and SpaceX employees are \u201Cworking on ventilators\u201D even though he doesn\u2019t believe they will be needed. His confirmation on Twitter that both of the companies he leads are working on ventilators comes a day after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio made a direct plea to Musk to help alleviate a shortage at hospitals gearing up to combat COVID-19.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Uber Eats is waiving delivery and activation fees in the UK to support restaurants hit by decreasing demand during the coronavirus crisis. The measure will apply until March 31 when it says it will review it. On Monday the on-demand food delivery giant announced a similar waiver of delivery fees in the US. The announcement by Uber Eats UK comes shortly after Just Eat UK said it would reduce its commission and waive some fees for 30 days \u2014 as part of an emergency support package for partner restaurants struggling to cope with disruption to their businesses.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Privacy-hostile practices by tech giants face ongoing legislative challenges, but a pandemic is clearly an exceptional circumstance. These days, governments are now turning to the tech sector for help. US President Donald Trump was reported last week to have summoned a number of tech companies to the White House to discuss how mobile location data could be used for tracking citizens. And in another development this month he announced Google was working on a nationwide coronavirus screening site \u2014 in fact it\u2019s Verily, a different division of Alphabet. But concerns were quickly raised that the site requires users to sign in with a Google account, suggesting users\u2019 health-related queries could be linked to other online activity the tech giant monetizes via ads.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Diligent Robotics wants to give nurses a helper droid that can run errands for them around the hospital. The startup\u2019s bot Moxi is equipped with a flexible arm, gripper hand and full mobility so it can hunt down lightweight medical resources, navigate a clinic\u2019s hallways and drop them off for the nurse. With the world facing a critical shortage of medical care professionals, Moxi could help healthcare centers use their staff as efficiently as possible. And because robots can\u2019t be infected by COVID-19, they\u2019re one less potential carrier interacting with vulnerable populations.\r\n\r\nIn other news from around the web:\r\n\r\n\u2022 The Telegram app emerged a few years ago as a challenger to WhatsApp and took off largely in non-Western countries. A story today in the China Tech site Abacus explores how Telegram is emerging as an alternative source of news form outside China \u2018Great Firewall\u2019, and is being accessed by citizens there who are hungry for uncensored news about the COVID-19 pandemic. The \u201C2019-nCoV outbreak real-time broadcast,\u201D channel now has more than 87,000 subscribers, with recent messages getting between 15,000 and 20,000 views, according to Telegram channel\u2019s view counter.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Another report today in The Verge explores how Amazon workers across the US and in many other countries are finding themselves designated as \u201Ckey workers\u201D who must continue to show up to deliver goods nations, like the US, which have gone into an effective quarantine. However, many of those workers are concerned that safety precautions, benefits, and protections have not changed sufficiently to reflect the new reality of living and working in a pandemic, and that even Amazon warehouses that keep operating as everything else shuts down many workers there are of course likely to contract the virus.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Getaround is a startup that actually launched at TechCrunch Disrupt several years ago, and the car-sharing company has soared in distribution and valuation in the last few years. But with the coronavirus outbreak suddenly affecting people unwilling or unable to share a personal car that might well be owned by someone infected by the virus, Getaround is now experiencing a huge plunge in demand. As a result, the company is now, according to Bloomberg. reportedly seeking a sale after finding itself \u201Cdangerously short on cash\u201D, according to people familiar with the matter.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Over at Microsoft, the tech giant is now offering its Healthcare Bot service to organizations on the frontlines of the COVID-19 response to help screen patients for potential infection and care. As an example, the CDC just released a COVID-19 assessment bot that can quickly assess the symptoms and risk factors for people worried about infection, provide information and suggest the next course of action such as contacting a medical provider or, for those who do not need in-person medical care, managing the illness safely at home.\r\n\r\nThe news is significant because several healthcare startups such as Babylon Health and Ada Health already offer such AI-powered \u2018chat\u2019 apps which many will likely be turning to in this crisis.",

We just want a bridge.\u201D\r\n\r\nKey background: The Senate has been facing immense pressure to pass a coronavirus relief plan with the House and Trump administration as quickly as possible. Lawmakers have been negotiating into the weekend in a bid to meet the White House\u2019s Monday deadline for coming to an agreement. The massive legislation aims to reassure cratering financial markets by providing relief to workers, small businesses and industries that have been impacted by the spreading pandemic. \r\n\r\nBig number: The massive relief package, which was originally pegged at $1 trillion, includes measures like direct cash payments of up to $1,200 to struggling Americans and $300 billion in small business loans to companies with less than 500 employees. It also calls for over $200 billion in federal aid for airlines and other distressed industries, like in the travel and tourism industry.\r\n\r\nWhat to watch for: What stimulus measures have been added to the package to double the size of the legislation. While Kudlow did not specify any new provisions that have been agreed upon, negotiators are reportedly discussing more unemployment insurance, more funding to hospitals and establishing state stabilization funds.",

Lawmakers this weekend are pushing to meet the Trump administration\u2019s Monday deadline of coming to an agreement. \r\n\r\nThe proposed $2 trillion package is the third coronavirus relief package. President Trump this week signed a $100 billion aid package that includes provisions for emergency paid leave for workers and free testing. That came after he signed a $8.3 billion package earlier in the month to provide federal aid to government health officials and vaccine research and development.\r\n\r\nUnemployment claims next week could total three million, Bank of America said this week, as some workers get laid off without severance, paid leave or health insurance. Hospitals are also facing equipment and staff shortages amid the crisis. \r\n\r\nThe Trump administration is under pressure over the shortage of important medical supplies. President Trump at a Saturday press briefing said he hasn\u2019t used the Defense Production Act, which would order private sector manufacturing of supplies like masks and ventilators, because the administration has seen some corporations volunteering help.\r\n\r\n\r\nAsked about the potential $2 trillion price tag for the latest relief package, the president said: \u201CI\u2019ve spoken directly or indirectly to everybody many, many times...I think the Democrats and the Republicans are going to come up with a package that\u2019s going to be really something.\u201D \r\n\r\nAcross the U.S., millions of Americans are being told to isolate themselves as coronavirus cases in the country pass 19,000, killing at least 260 people so far. Forty-five states have shut down all schools, and bars and restaurants have also closed in many areas as governments ban group gatherings.\r\n\r\nCalifornia and New York, among the largest economies in the U.S., have shut down all nonessential businesses indefinitely in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. Similar drastic measures have been taken or are planning to be taken in New Jersey, Illinois and Connecticut. ",

            "text": "Congress should temporarily raise monthly benefits for Social Security, Veterans and Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries as part of coronavirus relief efforts. \r\nIncreasing Social Security benefits is the quickest way to get money out the door during an economic crisis.\r\nFurthermore, Senate Republicans\u2019 proposal only provides half-benefits for individuals who need these checks most, like seniors on a fixed income or those who pay very little or no tax.\r\nPremium: Elizabeth Warren speaking 171004\r\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., during a Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on October 4, 2017.\r\nTom Williams | CQ Roll Call | Getty Images\r\nCongress is allocating billions of dollars to respond to coronavirus and a growing economic crisis \u2014 and those dollars need to be directed right into Americans\u2019 pockets.\r\n\r\nRight now, Americans are facing a public health crisis and an economic crisis. Coronavirus carries special risks for older Americans and people with underlying health conditions, who are following the advice of public health experts by staying home and staying away from other people in order to reduce their exposure to coronavirus. These Americans are scared about their heightened risk for severe illness \u2014 and scared about the future as they watch their retirement savings disappear as the pandemic shocks the U.S. economy.\r\n\r\nThat is why we are pushing to include in Congress\u2019 next stimulus package a $200 increase in the monthly benefit for all Social Security, Veterans, and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) beneficiaries through the end of 2021. This will put about $4,000 in the pockets of seniors and people with disabilities who have earned this benefit by contributing to Social Security with every paycheck. A simple benefit increase like this will improve the lives of millions of Americans and help our economy stabilize and recover. \r\n\r\nProviding Americans with one-time cash payments, as members of both parties have suggested, will certainly provide many families with a much-needed cushion to cover the costs of basic necessities like food and rent. But we should not neglect channels like Social Security and Unemployment Insurance that have long been a critical source of income security for workers, seniors and people with disabilities. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, Senate Republicans\u2019 proposal only provides half-benefits for individuals who need these checks most, like seniors on a fixed income or those who pay very little or no tax. Expanding Social Security and other benefits by $200 a month through 2021 will be a more stable and reliable source of support for these seniors and the economy as public health officials work to contain this virus.\r\n\r\nWhen the economy is in a downturn, getting it moving back in the right direction requires Americans to start spending money and researchers have found that permanent Social Security benefits increases have a \u201Clarge, immediate, and significant\u201D positive impact on spending. In fact, there is a nearly 1:1 ratio between an increase in Social Security benefits and an increase in consumer spending. That provides an enormous boost to the economy \u2014 and it starts with the very first month of increased benefits.\r\n\r\nNearly 64 million Americans received a Social Security check in 2019, the majority of whom were retired. Social Security makes up a majority of income for most seniors and older individuals with severe disabilities.\r\n\r\nBut millions of Americans relying on Social Security are still struggling to make ends meet. Nearly 10% of seniors are living in poverty, and the rate is higher for seniors of color and women. More than half of all low-income Americans receiving SSI benefits rely on the program as their only source of income. \r\n\r\nIncreasing Social Security benefits is the quickest way to get money out the door during an economic crisis. Congress has done this before: beneficiaries of Social Security and SSI received a one-time $250 benefit after the 2008 economic crisis as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  \r\n\r\nOur proposal ensures that increased benefits don\u2019t end up kicking Social Security and SSI recipients off other critical assistance programs during this crisis and the proposal assures that those who are more well-off pay back some of this expansion when they pay their taxes. It\u2019s a solution that helps families, boosts our economy, and starts at the grassroots. \r\n\r\nWe have a chance to stimulate our economy by taking care of Americans who need it the most. We need to match the scope of this crisis with bold solutions that invest in our country\u2019s future. ",

            "text": "The duration of the coronavirus pandemic will determine the length of the recession.\r\nThe market is trading at about 14 times forward earnings, if you assume 2021 earnings can rebound back to 2018-2019 levels. \r\nIt traded at 14.5 times forward earnings during the last correction at the end of 2018 but has bottomed at much lower multiples in history.\r\nI will, cautiously, stick with my earnings estimate of $160 to $165 for the S&P 500 next year and a bottom of 35% to 40% from the February peak.\r\nGP: A trader reacts during the opening bell drop\r\nA trader reacts during the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on February 28, 2020 at Wall Street in New York City.\r\nPhoto by Johannes Eisele | AFP | Getty Images\r\nWe are all exhausted and depressed, having experienced this week one of the worst stock market declines in modern history.\r\n\r\nI was there for the first one, on Oct. 18, 1987, when I stood with my colleagues around our communal Quotron screen while the market took a 20% jack-knife. \r\n\r\nCH 20200316_dow_one_day_losses.png\r\nLet\u2019s try to evaluate where the stock market might bottom.  This involves creating some framework to assess the implicit assumptions in the market, the business sustainability, cash flow and balance sheets of the companies in which we invest.\r\n\r\nAt the current price of 2,300, around 32% below the Feb. 19 peak, the S&P trades at about 14 times earnings for 2019.  If we assume that 2020 is a washout, and next year recovers to the 2018-19 level again of $165 per share, the market is still at 14 times forward earnings, which is generally not a rich multiple when considering 10-year Treasury rates are less than 1%. \r\n\r\nOne might ask, \u201CIs this multiple too high and is that earnings estimate too optimistic?\u201D \r\n\r\nThe market traded at 14.5 times forward earnings during the last correction at the end of 2018 but has bottomed at much lower multiples in history, including touching down 11 times forward earnings on March 9, 2009, the bottom during the financial crisis.\r\n\r\nWe might conclude that we\u2019re in the range, not outside the perimeter, but not at the low end.  There are still risks: In the last two weeks before the lowest close of that bear market, in 2009, the S&P plunged 20%, which represented a drop from 14 times to 11 times forward earnings. But, it rebounded quickly.\r\n\r\nHow about the earnings for the composite of $165 per share next year?  Since the key to predicting the rebound after a recession, is forecasting how long the recession lasts, we need to think through key variables. \r\n\r\nEstimating earnings with economy at a halt\r\nThe duration of the coronavirus pandemic will determine the length of the recession.  It won\u2019t become clear if social distancing works for a few weeks. Even with the precautions being taken by the public, the rate of daily growth in new cases is 35% to 50%, either end of which results in a range of 2.6 million to 26 million total cases nationwide in only three weeks, thanks to the powerful effect of compounding.  This is why we are in for a very tough situation in the next few months. Any outcome of this magnitude will grind the domestic economy to a halt.   \r\n\r\nHowever, new cases in China and South Korea have dropped dramatically. June 30 is still over a quarter away, with a third more days than the entire time since China officially recognized the virus\u2019 existence. Friends who live in Shanghai report that factories and commerce in China will be fully operational by mid-April, although the countries to whom they export goods will be hampered for many months. \r\n\r\nChart: Coronavirus mainland China 200401\r\nIf we extrapolate to the U.S. from China, where the negatives of dense pollution and heavy smoking that exacerbated the virus uptake were balanced by highly restrictive isolation that reduced the incidence, this suggests that the spread could fall significantly in less than two months, or by mid-May.  If commerce and demand resume in the second half, China will be ready to ship products and corporate earnings will begin to rebound in 2021.\r\n\r\nComparing to past recessions\r\nHow does this compare to other recessions, such as 2008?  The financial crisis was precipitated by reckless behavior of a small number of financial institutions employing millions of people. This recession will be triggered by the forced shutdown of millions of innocent small businesses employing much smaller work forces.\r\n\r\nIt was much easier to get bankers Jamie Dimon, Ken Lewis, and John Thain in a room with then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and then-New York Federal Reserve  President Timothy Geithner to negotiate one massive bailout for nine giant banks than to distribute funds so that every restaurant, bar, hair salon, and retailer (those still hanging on for dear life) receives some relief for their business and their staff. \r\n\r\nThe scenario that I feel most optimistic about is where we see a meaningful reduction in the virus growth rate over the next month, we relax some of the work and gathering restrictions and gradually bring back commerce and education.  A huge bailout is an essential element for multiple constituents.\r\n\r\n20200320 close SP500 bear market\r\nAt the risk of being accused of naivete, I realize cases are still in the logarithmic growth phase in the U.S. and other countries, but we are also watching China\u2019s progress, the sudden leap into action by the federal government, and the rise in available test kits.  Without places to gather like restaurants, bars, schools and workplaces, we are all forced to physically distance, regardless of our inclination. So, for the time being, I will, cautiously, stick with my earnings estimate of $160 to $165 for the S&P 500 next year and a bottom of 35% to 40% from the February peak.\r\n\r\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the market won\u2019t have 5% to 10% gyrations over the next couple of months both up and down, whenever it becomes hysterical about a rise in COVID-19 cases, unemployment claims, or an earnings\u2019 warning, but it feels as if there should be ample bargains to lure investors back at that point.

NFLX, +1.65% Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said Sunday that while the coronavirus outbreak has been a \"massive disruption\" to production, he doesn't expect any shortage of content in the coming months. During an interview on CNN, Sarandos said \"every one of our productions around the world are shut down\" due to the pandemic, and the streaming service is making efforts to make sure production professionals are still paid during the shutdown. Sarandos said \"viewing is up\" as millions of people stay home to avoid spreading the COVID-19 illness. But while Netflix has plenty of new shows in its pipeline, he said an extended shutdown could affect new releases later this year. \"We're pretty far ahead, so we don't see any disruption in our output over the next few months,\" he said. \"You know, maybe later in the year, if this progresses long, you'll start feeling some of that as the physical production is not operating.",

Other companies, including Google, Amazon and Microsoft, as well as a number of academic institutions, are also \u201Ccontributing lots of different things,\u201D the president said.\r\n\r\nWhile Trump\u2019s comments were characteristically unclear, IBM provided more details, noting that it is working with a number of national labs and other institutions to offer a total of 330 petaflops of compute to various projects in epidemiology, bioinformatics and molecular modeling. Amazon, Google and Microsoft are also part of the consortium, which is being led by IBM, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the Department of Energy.\r\n\r\nIBM and its partners will coordinate the efforts to evaluate proposals and provide access to high-performance computing resources to those that are most likely to have an immediate impact.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow can supercomputers help us fight this virus? These high-performance computing systems allow researchers to run very large numbers of calculations in epidemiology, bioinformatics, and molecular modeling. These experiments would take years to complete if worked by hand, or months if handled on slower, traditional computing platforms,\u201D writes Dario Gil, IBM\u2019s Director of Research.\r\n\r\nAWS has already dedicated $20 million to support COVID-19 research while Microsoft has already announced a number of different initiatives, though mostly around helping businesses cope with the fallout of this crisis. Google has now launched its own coronavirus website (though it\u2019s very different from the one Trump once promised) and Alphabet\u2019s Verily is helping Bay Area residents find testing sites if needed.\r\n\r\nAfter today\u2019s announcement, the White House shared statements from Microsoft,  Google and other partners. \u201CWe know that high performance computing can reduce the time it takes to process massive data sets and perform complex simulations from days to hours,\u201D said Mike Daniels, Vice President, Global Public Sector at Google  Cloud, in his statement. \u201CWe look forward to participating in this initiative alongside leaders in technology, academia and the public sector to make more resources available to COVID-19 researchers and to apply Google Cloud computing capabilities toward the development of potential treatments and vaccines.\u201D\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Microsoft\u2019s global head for its AI for Health Program, John Kahan, notes that Microsoft wants to \u201Cmake sure researchers working to combat COVID-19 have access to the tools they need\u201D by expanding access to its Azure cloud and by creating more opportunities for researchers to collaborate with the company\u2019s data scientists.\r\n\r\n\u201CToday I\u2019m also announcing the launch of a new public\/private consortium organized by the White House, the Department of Energy and IBM to unleash the power of American supercomputing resources to fight the Chinese virus,\u201D Trump, who continues to insist on calling COVID-19 \u2018the Chinese virus,\u2019 said in today\u2019s press briefing.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe following leaders from private industries, academia and government will be contributing and they are gonna be contributing a lot of different things, but compute primarily \u2014 computing resources to help researchers discover new treatments and vaccine. They will be working along with NIH and all of the people working on this. But tremendous help from IBM, Google, Amazon,  Microsoft, MIT, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the Department of Energy\u2019s, the National Science Foundation  and NASA. They are all contributing to this effort.\u201D",
